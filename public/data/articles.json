Let’s up the game. I want to talk about AGI. Right now, AI is narrow—it’s great at specific tasks but doesn’t truly ‘understand’ or ‘think’ like a human."

A true Artificial General Intelligence will be able to learn anything, reason, adapt, and apply knowledge across different domains without our constant input. It won’t just crank out music or code—it’ll figure out which music needs to exist and what code the world should run on."

It’ll write, compose music, design buildings, all without specialised training. It’ll solve problems in new ways, identify new problems even, re-frame the way things come together and break apart. It won’t act on historical data; it’ll unleash a new way to think of thought itself. And that’s the core difference."

AGI will probably leverage intuition, like we do, and unlike AI, it won’t need massive datasets.

The 2040s—that’s probably when full AGI will learn and think across domains. Some think it’ll come sooner, but it depends on specific breakthroughs. We’ll see. But one thing’s for sure: when AGI arrives, it won’t just improve AI—it’ll transform human civilisation entirely."

The pessimistic one suggests that AGI controls everything, and humans become irrelevant—or even extinct if you’re deemed a threat. Either way, the real job disruption is a future AGI scenario, not just the AI we have today."
