# Decay (Pattern)

**Category:** Business Pattern

## The Problem

Advantages erode. Moats fill in. What worked yesterday stops working tomorrow.

Most businesses mistake current success for permanent advantage. They optimize existing strengths while competitors change the game.

Then they wake up irrelevant, wondering what happened.

## How We Saw It

Decay is constant. Not failure. Physics.

**TECHNOLOGY DECAY:** Your tech stack ages. What was cutting-edge becomes legacy. Maintenance cost increases. Innovation cost increases faster.

**TALENT DECAY:** Best people get recruited away. Institutional knowledge walks out the door. Team energy shifts from building to maintaining.

**MARKET DECAY:** Competitors copy advantages. Customers expect more for less. Your differentiation becomes table stakes.

**CUSTOMER DECAY:** Preferences shift. Alternatives multiply. Switching costs decrease. Loyalty is temporary.

Decay isn't preventable. It's manageable. Maintenance isn't optional.

## The Result

Decay mapping reveals:

- Where advantages are eroding faster than you think
- Which moats need constant reinforcement
- Where you're optimizing dying advantages
- Why standing still is moving backward

Decay is the default. Build faster than it erodes or watch advantages disappear.
