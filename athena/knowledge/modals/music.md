# Classical Music for Running

**Category:** Brand Positioning

## The Problem

A classical musician was incredibly talented but unknown. "Nobody cares about classical music anymore."

## How We Saw It

Classical music hadn't changed. Context had. People stream music while working, exercising, or commuting. Concert halls felt formal and inaccessible.

The music was beautiful. The context was wrong. We moved it.

## The Result

Launched curated playlists: "Classical for Focus," "Classical for Sleep," "Classical for Running."

Streams went from hundreds to hundreds of thousands. Same music. Different frame. Extraordinary became accessible by meeting people where they already were.
