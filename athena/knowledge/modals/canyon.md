# The £15K Canyon

**Category:** Customer Experience

## The Problem

A professional services firm had high consultation show-up rates but low conversion to paid work. "People like talking to us but won't commit."

## How We Saw It

The consultation was free. The next step was £15K. That's not a gap. That's a canyon.

Prospects liked the conversation but couldn't justify the jump. They needed a middle step. Something that proved value before the big commitment.

## The Result

Created a £2K diagnostic engagement. Small enough to say yes to. Valuable enough to demonstrate capability. Converted 60% of diagnostics to full projects.

Removed the existential leap. Built a bridge instead.
