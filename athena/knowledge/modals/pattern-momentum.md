# Momentum (Pattern)

**Category:** Business Pattern

## The Problem

Early wins compound. Early losses spiral. Direction matters more than speed.

Most businesses treat every quarter identically. Same planning cycle. Same review process. Same resource allocation.

Then they wonder why winning teams keep winning and struggling teams keep struggling despite "equal" support.

## How We Saw It

Momentum is asymmetric.

**WINNING MOMENTUM:** Success attracts resources, talent, attention. Best people want to join. Customers want in early. Partners prioritize you. Each win makes the next win easier.

**LOSING MOMENTUM:** Failure repels resources. Talent leaves. Customers wait. Partners deprioritize. Each loss makes the next loss more likely.

The gap between winning and losing momentum isn't linear. It's exponential. Small advantages compound into structural dominance. Small setbacks compound into irrelevance.

We identify which direction momentum is actually flowing. Then we either accelerate it or break it.

## The Result

Momentum mapping reveals:

- Where small investments create disproportionate returns
- Which initiatives are building vs. which are bleeding momentum
- Why killing failing projects early matters more than optimizing successful ones
- Where you're throwing resources at losing momentum

Momentum compounds. Recognize it early. Ride it or kill it. Never ignore it.
