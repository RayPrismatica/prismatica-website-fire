# Supply (Molecule)

**Category:** Business Molecule

## The Problem

Supply isn't how much you can produce. It's how much reaches the customer at the moment they want it.

Most businesses optimize production capacity. More inventory. Faster manufacturing. Better logistics.

Then they wonder why oversupply creates waste while customers still experience scarcity.

## How We Saw It

Supply has three failure modes:

**TOO LITTLE:** Demand exists but supply can't meet it. You lose revenue. Competitors fill the gap.

**TOO MUCH:** Supply exceeds demand. Inventory costs kill you. Prices collapse. Value destruction.

**WRONG PLACE/TIME:** Supply exists but isn't where customers need it when they need it. Might as well not exist.

The bottleneck is rarely production. It's usually distribution, timing, or information flow between demand signals and supply decisions.

Most businesses solve supply problems by adding capacity. We solve them by matching supply physics to demand physics.

## The Result

Supply mapping reveals:

- Where supply constraints are real vs. artificial
- Why adding capacity often makes the problem worse
- Where timing and distribution matter more than volume
- Which supply problems are actually demand problems in disguise

Supply isn't about how much you make. It's about matching production to consumption in time and space.
