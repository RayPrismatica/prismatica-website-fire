# The Warehouse That Wasn't

**Category:** Supply Chain Diagnostics

## The Problem

A logistics company was losing money. Everyone blamed the warehouse. "Too slow, too many mistakes, too expensive."

## How We Saw It

We watched the warehouse for three days. It wasn't slow. It was waiting. Orders arrived in bursts. Staff stood idle, then got slammed. The problem wasn't the warehouse. It was upstream.

Poor demand forecasting created chaos. The warehouse was just where the chaos became visible.

## The Result

Fixed forecasting. Smoothed order flow. Warehouse performance improved 40% without hiring anyone or changing a single process.

The bottleneck wasn't where everyone was looking.
