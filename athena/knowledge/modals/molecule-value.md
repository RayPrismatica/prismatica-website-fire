# Value (Molecule)

**Category:** Business Molecule

## The Problem

Value isn't what you deliver. It's what the customer perceives they're getting relative to what they're giving up.

Most businesses focus on features, quality, and capabilities. "We deliver X better than competitors."

Then they wonder why customers choose cheaper alternatives or don't choose at all.

## How We Saw It

Value is a ratio. What they get divided by what they give up.

**WHAT THEY GET:** Not features. Not quality. The specific problem solved or outcome achieved.

**WHAT THEY GIVE UP:** Not just price. Time. Effort. Switching costs. Uncertainty. Status. Opportunity cost.

Most businesses try to increase the numerator (add features). We work both sides:

Increase perceived value OR decrease perceived cost.

Sometimes removing features increases value. Sometimes raising price increases value. Physics depends on what the customer is actually optimizing for.

## The Result

Value mapping reveals:

- What customers are actually trading off (not what you think they're buying)
- Where perceived value and delivered value diverge
- Why cheaper competitors win despite inferior products
- Which value levers move customer behavior

Value isn't what you build. It's the gap between what they get and what they give up.
