# Risk (Molecule)

**Category:** Business Molecule

## The Problem

Risk isn't uncertainty. It's the probability and magnitude of outcomes you don't want.

Most businesses either ignore risk (move fast, break things) or overweight it (analysis paralysis).

Then they either fail catastrophically or miss opportunities while competitors move.

## How We Saw It

Risk has two dimensions that matter:

**PROBABILITY:** How likely is the bad outcome?

**MAGNITUDE:** If it happens, does it hurt or does it kill you?

Low probability, low magnitude: Ignore it.
Low probability, high magnitude: Insure against it or design it out.
High probability, low magnitude: Accept it and move on.
High probability, high magnitude: Don't do it or change the physics.

Most businesses treat all risk the same. We map which risks are existential and which are noise.

## The Result

Risk mapping reveals:

- Which risks are worth avoiding vs. which are worth taking
- Where you're optimizing for the wrong risk (legal vs. existential)
- Why perfect information doesn't eliminate risk
- Which risks compound and which are independent

Risk isn't something to eliminate. It's something to map, price, and decide whether to take.
