# The Search Nobody Needed

**Category:** Product Strategy

## The Problem

A SaaS company had feature requests stacking up. "Better search" was at the top. Six months of dev time estimated. Significant cost.

## How We Saw It

We asked why users needed better search. Turns out they didn't. They needed better organisation. They were searching because they couldn't find things. Different problem entirely.

Search would have made a broken system slightly more tolerable. We solved the actual problem instead.

## The Result

Redesigned information architecture in two weeks. Search volume dropped 60%. User satisfaction went up. Saved six months of development time and built something that actually worked.

Sometimes the feature request is a symptom, not the cure.
