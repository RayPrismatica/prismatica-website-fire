# Friction (Molecule)

**Category:** Business Molecule

## The Problem

Friction is anything that makes desired behavior harder than it needs to be. Steps. Delays. Confusion. Uncertainty.

Most businesses know friction exists. They run "optimization" projects. Remove steps. Improve UX. Speed things up.

Then they wonder why conversion barely moves despite all the "improvements."

## How We Saw It

Not all friction is equal. There are three types:

**GOOD FRICTION:** Slows down bad actors. Creates quality gates. Forces deliberation where it matters. This friction is a feature.

**BAD FRICTION:** Slows down good actors. Creates unnecessary steps. Adds cognitive load. This friction kills conversion.

**COMPETITIVE FRICTION:** Your friction vs. competitor friction. The gap determines switching behavior.

Most businesses try to remove all friction. We identify which friction protects value and which destroys it.

The goal isn't zero friction. It's optimal friction for the desired outcome.

## The Result

Friction mapping reveals:

- Where you're adding friction that protects vs. friction that repels
- Why removing friction sometimes reduces quality
- Which friction points cause abandonment vs. which create commitment
- Where competitor friction is lower and why that matters

Friction isn't the enemy. Misplaced friction is the enemy.
