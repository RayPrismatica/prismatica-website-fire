# Inertia (Pattern)

**Category:** Business Pattern

## The Problem

Organizations resist change. Not because people are lazy or stupid. Because change has real costs.

Switching systems breaks workflows. Reorganizing teams destroys institutional knowledge. New processes require training, mistakes, adjustment periods.

Most businesses underestimate inertia. They announce change, expect instant adoption, then blame culture when nothing moves.

## How We Saw It

Inertia isn't resistance. It's physics.

Every system has momentum in its current direction. Changing direction requires energy exceeding current momentum. Not matching it. Exceeding it.

The cost of staying still must exceed the cost of moving. Until that threshold is crossed, nothing happens. No amount of communication, inspiration, or mandate changes this.

We don't fight inertia. We either increase the pain of staying still or decrease the friction of moving. Usually both.

## The Result

Understanding inertia reveals:

- Why change initiatives fail despite leadership support
- Where you need forcing functions vs. where you need incentives
- Which changes require crisis and which require patience
- Why early wins matter more than perfect plans

Inertia isn't the enemy. It's the operating reality. Work with it or waste energy fighting physics.
