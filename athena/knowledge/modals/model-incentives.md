# The Incentive Polarity (Mental Model Modal)

**Category:** Mental Model

## The Problem

Sales says they want better leads. What they optimize for is easy closes.

Product says they want user feedback. What they optimize for is no complaints.

Executives say they want innovation. What they optimize for is no surprises.

Watch what they do, not what they say.

## How We Saw It

People optimize for what they're measured on. Always.

Even when they disagree with the measurement. Even when it contradicts stated values.

You want to know what a business actually optimizes for? Look at compensation structure. Promotion criteria. What gets celebrated. What gets punished.

Then compare that to stated objectives. The gap explains most organizational dysfunction.

The Incentives model maps actual optimization versus stated objectives. Fix the forces. Behavior follows.

## The Result

When you fix incentives:

- Behavior changes without mandates
- Culture changes without initiatives
- Strategy changes without retreats
- Execution changes without processes
