# The Demand Flywheel (Mental Model Modal)

**Category:** Mental Model

## The Problem

Rolex doesn't sell watches. Peloton doesn't sell bikes. Slack doesn't sell chat.

They sell status, tribe membership, professional identity. Your product is the excuse. The demand is primal.

Miss this and your marketing is just noise.

## How We Saw It

Demand exists in three states:

**LATENT:** The problem exists but people don't know it yet. Make the problem visible before you can sell the solution.

**EXPRESSED:** People say they want it. But saying and paying are different physics. Most expressed demand evaporates at transaction.

**REVEALED:** People vote with money, time, or behavior change. This is the only demand that matters.

Most businesses optimize for expressed demand. We only trust revealed demand.

The Demand model maps what people actually want versus what they say they want. Watch behavior, not surveys.

## The Result

Understanding demand reveals:

- What customers are really buying (not what you're selling)
- Why product-market fit is about revealed demand physics
- Where phantom demand is wasting resources
- Which customer segments have real vs. fake demand
