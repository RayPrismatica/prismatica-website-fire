# Incentives (Particle)

**Category:** Business Particle

## The Problem

Every business runs on incentives. Compensation. Promotion. Recognition. Status. Avoiding blame.

Most businesses say they want one thing. Then they incentivize the opposite.

Then they wonder why innovation dies, collaboration fails, and short-term thinking dominates despite all the mission statements.

## How We Saw It

Incentives aren't motivations. They're forces that shape behavior whether anyone is conscious of them or not.

People optimize for what they're measured on. Always. Even when they disagree with the measurement. Even when it contradicts stated values.

You want to know what a business actually optimizes for?

Look at compensation structure. Promotion criteria. What gets celebrated. What gets punished.

Then compare that to stated objectives. The gap explains most organizational dysfunction.

We don't ask "how do we motivate people?" We ask "what are people currently incentivized to do?"

## The Result

When you fix incentives:

- Behavior changes without mandates
- Culture changes without initiatives
- Strategy changes without retreats
- Execution changes without processes

You don't need to convince people. You don't need to inspire them. You don't need to manage them harder. You need to stop paying them to do the wrong thing.

People follow physics. Change the forces. Behavior follows.
