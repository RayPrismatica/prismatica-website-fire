# From Retail to Platform

**Category:** Business Model Evolution

## The Problem

A specialised retailer was competing on price and losing. "Amazon has everything cheaper. How do we compete?"

## How We Saw It

They couldn't compete on price. But they had something Amazon didn't: expertise. Their customers were enthusiasts who valued knowledge, not just products.

We saw an opportunity to stop selling things and start enabling people.

## The Result

Transformed from retailer to platform. Added forums, guides, expert Q&A. Products became tools within a knowledge ecosystem.

Revenue shifted from margin on goods to platform subscriptions. Customer lifetime value tripled. Amazon became irrelevant to their model.
