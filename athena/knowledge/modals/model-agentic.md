# The Agentic Edge (Mental Model Modal)

**Category:** Mental Model

## The Problem

Humans need meetings, check-ins, approvals, reassurance.

AI doesn't.

Give it clear objectives, hard constraints, quality thresholds, and kill switches. Then let it run while you sleep.

The bottleneck isn't the AI. It's your need to feel in control.

## How We Saw It

Agentic systems work differently than human systems.

**HUMANS:** Need context, motivation, feedback loops, social dynamics. Coordination is expensive. Scaling is hard.

**AGENTS:** Need clear objectives, constraints, and decision rules. Coordination is cheap. Scaling is trivial.

Most businesses try to manage AI like humans. Meetings. Status updates. Approvals.

The Agentic model maps how to design systems that run autonomously. Define the physics. Let it operate.

## The Result

Agentic thinking reveals:

- Where human oversight adds value vs. where it adds friction
- How to design objectives that scale without supervision
- Why most AI deployments fail (treating AI like interns)
- Where autonomous systems multiply capacity
