# Constraints

**Category:** Business Particle

## The Problem

Every business operates within constraints. Regulatory. Technical. Economic. Cultural.

Most businesses see constraints as problems to overcome. Limitations to fight. Obstacles to remove.

Then they waste energy fighting physics instead of using it.

## How We Saw It

Constraints aren't obstacles. They're the shape of possibility.

A constraint eliminates infinite bad options and reveals finite good ones. It forces clarity. It creates moats. It determines which strategies are viable and which advantages are defensible.

Twitter's 140-character limit wasn't a limitation. It was the product.
Netflix's bandwidth constraint forced better compression. That became their technical moat.
Amazon's "two pizza teams" constraint forced better APIs. That became AWS.

Most businesses fight constraints. We identify which to embrace and which to route around.

## The Result

Constraint mapping reveals:

- Where you're fighting physics vs. where you can use physics
- Which limitations create differentiation
- Where the constraint is actually your advantage
- Which problems disappear when you accept the constraint

The constraint isn't the problem. Fighting the wrong constraint is the problem.
