# The Prismatic Mindset (Mental Model Modal)

**Category:** Mental Model

## The Problem

Every industry thinks it's special. None of them are.

Nightclubs and enterprise sales are both gatekeeping. Museums and Netflix are both attention retention. Airports and emergency rooms are both triage under constraints.

See structure, not surface, and solutions transfer instantly.

## How We Saw It

Industries are different surfaces on identical physics.

Retail, SaaS, consulting, manufacturing, healthcare. Different vocabularies. Different constraints. Same fundamental forces.

Supply. Demand. Friction. Value. Risk. Time. Actors. Incentives.

The Prismatic model strips away industry-specific language to reveal universal structure. Once you see the pattern, solutions from completely unrelated domains become obviously applicable.

## The Result

Prismatic thinking reveals:

- Which "industry-specific" problems are actually universal
- How solutions from unrelated fields solve your exact situation
- Why best practices within your industry are often collectively stupid
- Where cross-domain pattern matching creates unfair advantages
