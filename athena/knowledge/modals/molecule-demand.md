# Demand (Molecule)

**Category:** Business Molecule

## The Problem

Demand isn't what people say they want. It's what they'll actually pay for, use, or change behavior to get.

Most businesses confuse expressed interest with real demand. Survey responses with purchase intent. Clicks with commitment.

Then they build for phantom demand and wonder why adoption fails despite "overwhelming interest."

## How We Saw It

Demand has three states:

**LATENT:** The problem exists but people don't know it yet. You have to make the problem visible before you can sell the solution.

**EXPRESSED:** People say they want it. But saying and paying are different physics. Most expressed demand evaporates at the point of transaction.

**REVEALED:** People vote with money, time, or behavior change. This is the only demand that matters.

Most businesses optimize for expressed demand. We only trust revealed demand. Watch what people do, not what they say.

## The Result

Demand mapping reveals:

- Where phantom demand is wasting resources
- Which customer segments have revealed vs. expressed demand
- What makes latent demand become revealed demand
- Why product-market fit is about revealed demand physics

Demand isn't what people want. It's what they'll sacrifice something else to get.
