# The Coaching Wave

**Category:** Leadership Coaching

## The Problem

A leadership coaching company was successful. But they sensed something shifting in the market. They couldn't articulate what. Just a feeling that the ground was moving.

## How We Saw It

We noticed massive growth in the "coaching galaxy." Not just volume—type. Strategic leadership coaching was about to shift from efficiency-focused to ownership and accountability at the internal human level.

The wave was coming. History repeats. AI adoption dynamics mirror smartphone adoption dynamics. We just watch for the patterns.

## The Result

Our client pivoted their entire service model before the wave arrived. They rode it instead of scrambling to catch up.

They weren't reacting to the shift. They were positioned for it.
