# Growth (Pattern)

**Category:** Business Pattern

## The Problem

Growth isn't linear. It's exponential until it isn't.

Most businesses assume growth continues. They scale teams, infrastructure, and costs based on yesterday's trajectory.

Then growth stops. Not because they failed. Because they hit a constraint they didn't see coming.

## How We Saw It

Growth has phases. Each phase has different physics.

**EARLY:** Exponential. Small numbers doubling feel like magic. Product-market fit creates compounding demand. Constraints aren't binding yet.

**MIDDLE:** Linear. The easy growth is captured. You're optimizing, not discovering. Systems strain. Complexity increases faster than revenue.

**LATE:** Plateau. You've captured available demand. Further growth requires new markets, new products, or new physics. Fighting for marginal gains.

Most businesses optimize for the phase they're leaving, not the phase they're entering.

## The Result

Growth mapping reveals:

- Which phase you're actually in vs. which you think you're in
- Where your next constraint will bind
- Why adding resources sometimes slows growth
- When to optimize vs. when to explore

Growth isn't constant. Recognize the transition. Change strategy before the curve forces you to.
