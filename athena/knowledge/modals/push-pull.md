# From Push to Pull

**Category:** Market Positioning

## The Problem

A B2B service was spending heavily on outbound sales. High effort, low conversion. "Our market doesn't understand what we do."

## How We Saw It

The market understood fine. They just didn't care yet. The company was pushing a solution before prospects felt the problem.

We shifted strategy: make the problem visible first. Then let prospects come to them.

## The Result

Built a diagnostic tool that showed companies where they were losing money. Didn't sell anything. Just made the problem impossible to ignore.

Inbound requests tripled. Sales cycle shortened by half. Same product. Different approach.
