# The Triptych Nexus (Mental Model Modal)

**Category:** Mental Model

## The Problem

Most companies fight the wrong battle.

They add supply when friction is killing them. Remove friction when demand doesn't exist. Build features when distribution is broken.

Stop guessing. Map the forces. Fix what's actually stuck.

## How We Saw It

Every business problem is Supply, Demand, or Friction.

**SUPPLY PROBLEM:** You can't deliver. Capacity, resources, or capabilities are the constraint.

**DEMAND PROBLEM:** Nobody wants it. The problem isn't visible or the solution isn't compelling.

**FRICTION PROBLEM:** They want it, you can deliver it, but something is blocking the transaction.

Most businesses misdiagnose which problem they have. They optimize the wrong variable.

The Triptych model maps which force is actually constraining growth. Then you fix that. Not everything else.

## The Result

Triptych mapping reveals:

- Which of the three forces is actually binding
- Why adding resources sometimes makes problems worse
- Where you're solving the wrong constraint beautifully
- What to fix first for maximum leverage
