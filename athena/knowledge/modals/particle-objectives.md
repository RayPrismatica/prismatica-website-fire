# Objectives

**Category:** Business Particle

## The Problem

Every business has objectives. Revenue. Growth. Market share. Customer satisfaction. Innovation.

Most businesses declare all of them simultaneously. Then wonder why teams pull in opposite directions.

You can't optimize for everything at once. Physics doesn't work that way.

## How We Saw It

Objectives aren't destinations. They're forces pulling behavior in specific directions.

When objectives conflict, energy gets wasted:

Sales wants revenue now. Product wants sustainable growth.
Marketing wants brand consistency. Growth wants rapid experimentation.
Engineering wants technical excellence. Operations wants speed.

Everyone is optimizing correctly for their stated objective. The system is broken because the objectives haven't been stack-ranked.

Most businesses avoid choosing. We force the choice.

## The Result

Objective clarity eliminates coordination problems:

- Teams stop fighting over resources
- Trade-offs become obvious
- Decisions accelerate
- Energy stops getting wasted on internal politics

You can't have it all. Pick what matters. Optimize for that. Accept the trade-offs.
