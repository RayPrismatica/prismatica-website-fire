# Resources

**Category:** Business Particle

## The Problem

Every business has finite resources. Capital. Attention. Talent. Infrastructure.

Most businesses assume more resources solve problems. More budget. More headcount. More tools.

Then they wonder why adding resources created more complexity instead of more output.

## How We Saw It

Resources aren't things you have. They're constraints that determine what's possible.

Adding capital doesn't solve execution problems.
Adding headcount doesn't solve coordination problems.
Adding tools doesn't solve process problems.
Adding data doesn't solve decision problems.

The bottleneck is rarely the resource everyone is focused on. It's usually three steps upstream, invisible, and structural.

We don't ask "what resources do you need?" We ask "what's actually constraining throughput?"

## The Result

Resource mapping reveals:

- Where adding more creates leverage vs. where it creates drag
- Which constraints are binding vs. which are red herrings
- Where you're resource-rich but capability-poor
- Why throwing money at problems often makes them worse

The bottleneck is never where you think it is. Find it. Fix it. Ignore everything else.
