# The Misdiagnosed Bottleneck

**Category:** Operational Efficiency

## The Problem

A manufacturing company had a "slow approval process." Projects stalled waiting for sign-off. Frustration everywhere.

## How We Saw It

Approvals weren't slow. They were being asked to approve things that weren't ready. Incomplete briefs, unclear requirements, missing data.

The approval step was where poor preparation became visible. Fixing "the approval process" would have made it faster to approve bad work.

## The Result

Implemented a pre-approval checklist. Nothing reached approval until it met minimum standards. Approvals got faster because the work got better.

The bottleneck wasn't the gate. It was everything before it.
