# Time

## The Problem

Time isn't a resource you manage. It's a force that acts on everything.

Most businesses treat time as something to fight. Rush to market. Delay to perfect. Miss the window entirely.

Then they wonder why competitors moved, markets shifted, and opportunities closed while they were still debating timelines.

## How We Saw It

Time creates different physics depending on velocity.

**TOO SLOW:** Opportunity closes. Competitors move. What was viable becomes impossible.

**TOO FAST:** Quality suffers. Foundation cracks. You ship something that creates more problems than it solves.

**JUST RIGHT:** Momentum builds. Compounding kicks in. Timing advantage becomes structural advantage.

The question isn't "how fast can we move?" It's "what velocity matches the physics of this specific problem?"

## The Result

Understanding time dynamics reveals:

- Which advantages are temporary vs. structural
- When speed matters more than perfection (and vice versa)
- Where delay creates optionality vs. where it destroys value
- Why some problems require patient capital and others require sprint thinking

Time is the dimension where all other forces play out. Get the tempo wrong and everything else fails.
