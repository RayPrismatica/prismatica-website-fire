# Information

**Category:** Business Particle

## The Problem

Every business runs on information. Market signals. Customer feedback. Competitor moves. Internal metrics.

Most businesses collect data. Lots of data. Then wonder why they still make bad decisions.

Information isn't data. It's who knows what, when, with what confidence, and whether they can act on it.

## How We Saw It

Information creates three types of advantage:

**ASYMMETRY:** You know something others don't. That's arbitrage.
**SPEED:** You know something before others do. That's timing.
**CLARITY:** You know the right thing while others drown in noise. That's focus.

Most businesses try to collect more information. We map information flow:

Where is it blocked?
Where is it distorted?
Where does it arrive too late to matter?

Information problems look like strategy problems, execution problems, or culture problems. They're not. They're physics problems.

## The Result

Information mapping reveals:

- Where asymmetry creates opportunity
- Where information flow is broken
- Why coordination fails (someone doesn't know what someone else knows)
- Where signal is being drowned by noise

Most coordination problems disappear when you fix information flow. No meetings required.
