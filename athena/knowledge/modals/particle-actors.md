# Actors

**Category:** Business Particle

## The Problem

People aren't rational agents. They're actors with incentives, constraints, and competing priorities.

Most businesses take stated preferences at face value. "Customers want feature X. Sales needs better leads. Execs want innovation."

Then they build what was requested and wonder why nobody uses it, conversion stays flat, and innovation dies in committee.

## How We Saw It

Watch what actors optimize for, not what they say they want.

**CUSTOMERS** don't buy products. They buy the story they tell themselves about buying the product.

**EMPLOYEES** don't want purpose. They want clarity, autonomy, and proof their work matters.

**EXECUTIVES** don't want data. They want cover for decisions they've already made.

**COMPETITORS** don't want market share. They want to survive, grow, and avoid existential threats.

Every actor is solving their own optimization problem. Strategy fails when you mistake stated preferences for actual objectives.

## The Result

Predicting behavior becomes simple:

- Map the forces acting on each actor
- Identify what they're actually optimizing for
- Understand their constraints and alternatives
- Watch where incentives misalign with stated objectives

Once you see the physics, behavior becomes predictable. Not because actors are simple, but because forces are consistent.
