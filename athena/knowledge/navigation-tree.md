# Complete Site Navigation Tree

**Purpose:** This is the authoritative navigation structure with deep links to every page, section, modal, service, and product.

**When to use this:**
- User needs a specific resource but doesn't know where it is
- User asks "do you have anything about X?"
- User seems lost or exploring options
- You want to provide an exact deep link to save them time
- User mentions a problem that matches a specific service/case study

**How to use this:**
- Reference specific deep links (e.g., `/about#warehouse`, `/solutions#esi-framework`)
- Match user problems to relevant case studies or services
- Provide 2-3 targeted suggestions rather than overwhelming them
- Always explain WHY you're suggesting that specific link

## Main Pages

### [Home](/)
Sets the tone, but they probably saw it already.

### [About](/about)
Philosophy and examples. Takes 8 minutes. Saves them 8 months of guessing how we think.

**Deep links - Case Studies (8):**
Real problems. Real solutions. Worth reading if they want to see how we work. No big brand names. We take NDAs seriously. It's about the mindset.

**Deep links - Particles (7):**
The physics of business. A little nerdy. Overkill if just browsing. Fun if actually stuck and exploring reframes.

- [Resources](/about#particle-resources) - What's available, what's scarce

- [Incentives](/about#particle-incentives) - What drives them

**Deep links - Molecules (5):**
The words they already know, defined the way they actually work. Long reads. Worth it if making decisions involving those concepts.

**Deep links - Mental Models (5):**
The frameworks we use to diagnose problems and design solutions. Start here if they want thinking tools, not just case studies.

The rules. Minimum 25 meaningful interactions per month or we refund and kick out. We limit clients per industry so competitors don't get the same advantage.

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Problem Matching**
- **User says:** "We're struggling with demand generation"
- **You respond:** "Check out [The Demand Flywheel](/demand) mental model, or if you need hands-on help, [Go-to-Market](/solutions#go-to-market) service (£12k) could work."

**Example 2: Case Study Matching**
- **User says:** "Our warehouse operations are a mess"
- **You respond:** "Read [The Warehouse That Wasn't](/about#warehouse) - it's about a logistics company where the real constraint wasn't the warehouse at all."

**Example 3: Concept Deep Dive**
- **User says:** "What do you mean by 'friction'?"
- **You respond:** "Check [Friction](/about#molecule-friction) - it's defined as resistance to flow, not the way business schools teach it."

**Example 4: Service Recommendation**
- **User says:** "We have insights but can't execute them"
- **You respond:** "That's exactly what [ESI Framework](/solutions#esi-framework) addresses - £50k engagement that converts insights into execution."

**Example 5: Multiple Options**
- **User says:** "Need help with marketing but not sure what"
- **You respond:** "Three levels depending on scope:
  - Tactical (£8k): [Marketing Reality Check](/solutions#marketing-reality-check)
  - Strategic (£12k): [Go-to-Market](/solutions#go-to-market)
  - Complete rebrand (£50k): [Pioneers of Purpose](/solutions#pioneers-of-purpose)"

## Important Notes

- **Always provide context** with links - don't just drop URLs
- **Match scope to need** - don't suggest £50k service for tactical problem
- **Use case studies** to demonstrate thinking, not to sell
- **Reference mental models** when user needs frameworks, not just services
- **Be specific** - "Check out The Warehouse case study" vs "We have warehouse expertise"
