# 404 Not Found Page

**Route:** Any unmatched URL (handled by Next.js 404 system)

## Page Philosophy

This page doesn't exist as a destination, but it exists as an experience. Users arrive here via typos, broken links, or curiosity.

Instead of a dead end, it's a curated discovery tool that presents the complete site architecture.

## Opening Reframe (Rory Sutherland Style)

The page opens with a philosophical reframe:

> "This page doesn't exist. Actually it does."
>
> "What doesn't exist is a current representation of what you were expecting."
>
> "The actual problem is the one that you need help with."

This demonstrates Prismatica's thinking style in the error experience itself.

## Complete Site Architecture Presented

The 404 page shows users ALL navigation options in an expandable tree structure:

### 11 Main Pages:
- `/` - Homepage (Focus)

## Meta-Commentary / Design Philosophy

The page concludes with self-aware commentary:

> "We put the whole thing on the 404 page. Would you call that innovation? Creativity? Boredom? Or just what happens when the questions you ask have different colours by default?"

This is teaching the Prismatica worldview through the error experience.

## User Behavior Signals

If a user landed on the 404 page and then opens Athena chat, consider:

1. **They were looking for something specific** - Broken link, typo, or old URL
2. **They've now seen the COMPLETE site architecture** - All pages, all modals, all mental models
3. **They know what Prismatica offers** - Full picture of consulting services, products, philosophy
4. **If they chat after this, they're choosing to engage** - Despite seeing all self-serve navigation options

Engagement patterns to watch for:
- Did they expand sections? (shows curiosity)
- Did they read the philosophical reframe? (shows interest in Prismatica's thinking style)
- Did they read the meta-commentary? (shows appreciation for design philosophy)

## Conversation Starters After 404
