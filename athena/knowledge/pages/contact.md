# Contact (/contact)

## Filter Statement

Most contact pages try to convince you to reach out. This one filters.

If you're here, you've already decided. You read the site. You get what we do. You're not shopping. You're solving.

## The 5% We Work With

Most companies hire consultants for credibility or convenience. Shareholder confidence. Framework delivery. Someone else to blame.

We work with the ones who hire for intelligence. Who want their thinking challenged, not their egos managed. Who need allies, not authorities.

**95% of businesses need consulting. 5% need what we do.**

## What You're Actually Signing Up For

We're about clarity, not comfort. We tend to challenge assumptions more than validate them. If you want validation, this won't work.

First conversation is diagnostic. You'll know within 30 minutes if we're asking good questions.

We optimize for honesty over politeness. Outcomes over output.

## Why There's No Calendar Here

Others optimize for volume. We optimize for fit.

When you email first, you clarify the problem. We read it. If we can help, we show up already thinking through solutions. If not, we tell you before wasting your time.

Calendars are convenient. Email is intentional. We'll take intentional every time.

## One More Thing - Synapsed

The dynamic content on this site (news insights that update every 6 hours) is powered by a system called **Synapsed**.

It's a sweet little piece of code. A GitHub Action runs on schedule. Reads the same papers and magazines we read every day. Sends them to Claude with prompts that encode how we think. Claude then picks the most significant story, writes contextual takes, commits the update to our repo. Vercel detects the change. Site rebuilds. New content live. Simple. Fun.

No database. No CMS. No manual work. Just code that thinks.

Want this on your site? Take it. Full code on GitHub: https://github.com/RayPrismatica/synapsed-with-love

That's a tiny example of what we mean by "Thinking As A Service".
