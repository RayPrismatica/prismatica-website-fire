## PIECE 1: Landing Page - News Insight (✨ AI-GENERATED)

**WHERE:** Homepage, first paragraph after main heading
**WHAT:** Meta just won its antitrust case against the FTC. Everyone sees big tech beating regulators again. We see something else: if your business model requires explaining why you're not a monopoly, you've already lost the positioning game.

---

## PIECE 2: Contact Page - Content Reminder (✨ AI-GENERATED)

**WHERE:** Contact page, reminds them of what they saw on landing page
**WHAT:** Remember how the landing page showed Meta winning against regulators? Well...

---

---

## Solutions Page - Service Descriptions (All ✨ AI-GENERATED)

### PIECE 3: Pioneers of Purpose
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Bill Gates is wrong about climate change, says Bill McKibben. Another titan missing the forest for the tech trees. Watch leaders everywhere confuse activity with purpose, efficiency with meaning. Pioneers of Purpose dissects why your business actually exists (hint: it's not the mission statement on reception). We cascade that truth through every system, decision, and customer moment. Because when you can't explain why you matter beyond quarterly earnings, neither can your people.

### PIECE 4: ESI Framework (Explore, Synthesise, Ignite)
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** AMD's chips are falling. NVDA too. INTC as well. Everyone discovered brilliant AI strategies last quarter. Nobody knows how to execute them. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our systematic approach to closing that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths. Synthesise transforms chaos into executable clarity. Ignite ensures strategy actually moves through your organisation. Not another deck to gather dust. An operating system for turning insight into impact.

### PIECE 5: Secret Agency
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Glassdoor spotted 'forever layoffs' as 2026's workplace trend. CEOs cutting continuously while wondering why nothing improves. Classic high-performer trap: optimising the org chart instead of their own patterns. Secret Agency works with leaders who've outgrown their success formulas. When 70-hour weeks produce 30 hours of value. When every decision feels heavy. When delegation became impossible because you trained everyone to need you. Time to upgrade the operating system between your ears.

### PIECE 6: KSO Workshop (Knowledge Search Optimization)
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Google's boss admits AI investment has "elements of irrationality". Meanwhile everyone's still optimising websites for an algorithm that's becoming irrelevant. ChatGPT doesn't crawl pages. Perplexity cites knowledge, not URLs. KSO Workshop maps your intellectual territory so AI systems recognise you as the authority. Four weeks to transform from searchable to citable. Because being on Google's first page means nothing when AI answers the questions.

### PIECE 7: Transaction Architecture
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Viagogo under investigation for pricing tactics. Customers see numbers. Feel deceived. Leave. Transaction Architecture reveals why: they're optimising the visible price, ignoring the invisible value exchange. We map decisions across emotional trust, cognitive understanding, and tangible triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions naturally. Deep alignment that converts, not surface tricks that repel.

### PIECE 8: Strategic Triptych Assessment
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Meta keeps Instagram and WhatsApp. Dodged the breakup bullet. But look closer: they're still three separate products pretending to be one company. Classic symptoms hiding in plain sight. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Because your biggest problems live where marketing doesn't talk to product doesn't talk to strategy. The gaps where opportunity hides.

### PIECE 9: Go-to-Market
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Klarna beats revenue estimates before IPO. Solid fundamentals. Clear positioning. Focused execution. The opposite of most launches that spray budget and pray. Go-to-Market builds your complete strategy before you spend a pound. Who you're targeting first. What channels. What sequence. What message at each stage. Launch once, launch right. Because hope isn't a go-to-market strategy.

### PIECE 10: Creative That Converts
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** AI ads winning on creative effectiveness, Marketing Week reports. Brilliant. Except effectiveness without pricing power is just efficient commoditisation. Creative That Converts rebuilds your positioning based on what shifts perception AND willingness to pay. Every creative decision filtered through commercial impact. Because awards are nice but pricing power pays the bills.

### PIECE 11: Design Thinking
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Microsoft launches AI tools to reduce coder burnout. After years of building features nobody wanted. Should have tested with actual developers, not theorised in conference rooms. Design Thinking reframes problems entirely through rapid prototyping with real users. Sprint through assumptions. Test cheaply. Fail fast. Because six months building the wrong solution costs more than six weeks finding the right problem.

### PIECE 12: AI Without the Hallucination
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** "Agentic AI" is tech's new buzzword, says Fast Company. More jargon for the hype machine. Meanwhile smart operators quietly automate boring workflows that save actual hours. AI Without the Hallucination cuts through noise to find value. We map your processes, identify where AI adds real ROI, implement what works. Forget the ChatGPT screenshots. Show us the saved hours and freed revenue.

### PIECE 13: Process Surgery
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Full Swing's golf sim sees participation surge. Why? They eliminated friction, not added features. Most companies do the opposite: hire armies to manage broken workflows. Process Surgery finds the 20% causing 80% of pain. Cut what's broken. Streamline what matters. Stop hiring people to compensate for processes that shouldn't exist. Make work easier, not more documented.

### PIECE 14: Marketing Reality Check
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Christmas shopping patterns surprise retailers again this year, Forbes notes. Research predicted one thing. Behaviour showed another. Annual reminder that focus groups at 2pm don't capture how people actually shop at 2am. Marketing Reality Check watches real behaviour, not PowerPoint predictions. Find what's working despite your strategy. Reallocate budget based on patterns, not personas. Because customers vote with wallets, not words.

### PIECE 15: Focus Matrix
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** The social cost of being a morning person, Atlantic explores. Early birds get worms but miss evening insights. Just like executives who fill calendars without calculating expected value. Focus Matrix runs game theory on your time allocation. Which commitments compound? Which just fill space? Shows you where to go all-in and what to fold immediately. Your hours are chips. This teaches you to play them properly.

### PIECE 16: Value Channel Matrix
**WHERE:** Solutions page, full service description
**WHAT:** Sky Sports' Halo shut down. Strong features. Loyal users. Still failed. Why? The value exchange never balanced. Gave plenty but created no deep need. Value Channel Matrix maps every exchange dimension, tangible and intangible. Then engineers relationships where customers get 30% more than they give. That's when want becomes need. That's when churn becomes foreign concept. That's when price conversations end forever.
