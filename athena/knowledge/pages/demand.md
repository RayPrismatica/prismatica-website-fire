# The Demand Flywheel (/demand)

## Mental Model Overview

What people say they want and what they actually buy are rarely the same thing.

Most companies build products, then hunt for buyers. That's backwards.

Growth is demand driven. Not supply driven. Not product driven. Not business driven. Demand driven.

## The Reversal

Companies create systems that serve themselves. Design experiences that fit their processes. Build what's convenient for them, not what customers actually want.

They have it backward. Completely backward.

The companies that thrive look at their business through customer eyes, not at customers through business eyes.

This isn't philosophy. It's survival.

## The Abundance Problem

We live in the age of too much. Too much information. Too much selection. Too much noise.

Every market is saturated. Every niche is crowded. Every customer is overwhelmed.

Creating what nobody wants isn't business. It's waste. And markets punish waste brutally.

The question isn't "can we build it?" The question is "does anyone actually want this enough to change their behaviour?"

## The Mirror Principle

Most companies look at customers through their own lens. Their processes. Their logic. Their convenience.

Then they wonder why conversion rates stay low. Why churn stays high. Why growth plateaus.

Demand-driven companies flip the mirror. They see themselves through customer eyes. Every assumption gets tested. Every process gets questioned.

The view from the other side reveals truths you can't see from inside the building.

Most companies aren't listening to the signals. They're too busy broadcasting their message, too invested in their plan.

Smart companies listen first, speak second.

## The Friction Map

Every business has friction. The gap between what customers want and what you deliver.

Most companies add friction without realizing it. Complex pricing. Confusing navigation. Unnecessary steps. Death by a thousand paper cuts.

Demand-driven companies obsess over friction. They map it. Measure it. Eliminate it.

Because demand flows like water. It takes the path of least resistance. Always.

## What Changes

Start with demand and everything realigns.

Product roadmaps stop chasing features nobody wants. Marketing budget flows to channels that actually convert. Pricing reflects what people will pay, not what you hope they'll pay.

Churn drops. Acquisition costs drop. Lifetime value climbs.

Not because you worked harder. Because you stopped fighting the current.
