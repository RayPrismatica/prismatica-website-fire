# The Incentive Polarity (/incentives)

## Mental Model Overview

People don't do what you want them to do. They do what they're incentivized to do.

Water always finds its way. So do incentives.

Most organizations draft policies then wonder why nobody follows them. Create systems nobody uses. Launch products nobody wants.

## The Reversal

Companies try to control behavior with policies and procedures. Pointless.

They're fighting human nature instead of designing for it. Building dams instead of channels.

Smart companies don't fight the current. They redirect it.

## The Invisible Force

Smart leaders don't focus on what people say. They focus on what gets rewarded, what gets punished, what gets celebrated.

Boeing built planes that crashed because their incentives prioritized speed over safety. Wells Fargo created fake accounts because their incentives rewarded account creation over customer service.

Not complicated. Completely predictable.

## Psycho-Logic

Value is never objective. The coffee tastes better in expensive mugs. The medicine works better with colorful pills.

This isn't manipulation. This is human reality.

We call this psycho-logic. The actual logic of how people operate, not how economists wish they operated.

## The Tribal Force

The greatest incentive structures tap our primal need for belonging. They create tribes, not customers.

Apple users. Harley riders. CrossFit devotees.

Weak companies sell products. Strong companies create identities.

## What Changes

Align incentives properly and behavior shifts overnight.

Sales teams stop gaming metrics and start closing real deals. Support teams stop deflecting tickets and start solving problems. Marketing stops chasing vanity metrics and starts driving revenue.

Turnover drops. Performance climbs. The things you wanted all along start happening naturally.

Not through control. Through alignment.
