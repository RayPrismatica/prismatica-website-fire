## Red Flags to Watch For

When reviewing content, these are automatic rejections:

1. **Empty Superlatives**: "Best," "leading," "world-class" without evidence
2. **Buzzword Density**: More than one buzzword per paragraph
3. **Emotional Manipulation**: "Imagine," "feel," "picture this"
4. **Corporate Speak**: "Synergize," "leverage," "paradigm"
5. **Vague Promises**: "Better results," "improved outcomes" (quantify!)
6. **Long-Winded Openings**: More than 2 sentences before main point
7. **Visual Violations**: Colors, fonts, spacing not per VISUAL_IDENTITY.md

## Approval Criteria

Content is approved when:

✅ **Voice**: Sounds distinctly like Prismatica (intellectual, confident, clear)
✅ **Clarity**: Main point obvious within 2 sentences
✅ **Precision**: Claims specific and evidence-based
✅ **Structure**: Front-loaded, scannable, logical
✅ **Style**: No jargon, no fluff, no empty superlatives
✅ **Visual** (if applicable): Adheres to VISUAL_IDENTITY.md

If any criterion fails, content returns for revision.

## Remember

> "The brand is intellectual, not emotional. Precision over persuasion."

Every word should earn its place. Every claim should be defensible. Every sentence should serve the reader.

When in doubt:
1. Cut unnecessary words
2. Replace vague with specific
3. Use simpler language
4. Front-load the important part

**The goal isn't to sound smart—it's to make complex ideas clear.**
