4. **SEO Opportunity**: Can we rank for this?

**Priority Criteria:**

```

### Step 4: Content Creation

Most strategy decks become shelf-ware. Intelligence products compound.

Here's the difference:

Traditional Consulting:
→ Delivers PowerPoint
→ Insights captured in documents
→ Value peaks at delivery
→ Requires re-engagement for updates

Intelligence Products:
→ Delivers software + frameworks
→ Knowledge systematically captured
→ Value compounds over time
→ Continuously updated with AI

We're seeing executives shift from buying advice to building intelligence assets.

What's driving this in your industry?
