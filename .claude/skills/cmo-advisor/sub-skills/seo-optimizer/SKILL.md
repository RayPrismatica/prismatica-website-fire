## Keyword Research Process

### Step 1: Keyword Discovery

**Sources:**
- Google Search Console (what's already ranking)
- Ahrefs/SEMrush (competitor keywords)
- Answer The Public (question-based searches)
- Google Autocomplete (search suggestions)
- LinkedIn discussions (language audience uses)
- Client conversations (how they describe challenges)

**Brainstorming Framework:**
1. What problems do we solve? → Keywords
2. What products do we offer? → Keywords
3. What topics do we have expertise in? → Keywords
4. What do competitors rank for? → Keywords
5. What questions do executives ask? → Keywords

### Step 2: Keyword Evaluation

**Metrics to Check:**
- **Search Volume:** Monthly searches (prioritize 100+ for niche B2B)
- **Keyword Difficulty:** Competition level (target 0-40 initially)
- **Search Intent:** Informational, commercial, or transactional
- **Business Value:** Does this keyword indicate buying intent?

**Priority Matrix:**
```
High Volume + Low Difficulty + High Intent = Tier 1 (target immediately)
High Volume + Medium Difficulty + High Intent = Tier 2 (build toward)
Low Volume + Low Difficulty + High Intent = Tier 1 (quick wins)
High Volume + High Difficulty + Low Intent = Tier 3 (long-term)
```

### Step 3: Keyword Mapping

Assign keywords to pages:
| Page | Primary Keyword | Secondary Keywords | Search Volume | Difficulty |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Homepage | "strategic consulting AI" | "AI consulting services", "intelligence consulting" | 500/mo | 35 |
| ESI Product Page | "executive strategic intelligence" | "executive intelligence platform", "ESI software" | 150/mo | 25 |
| Services/Mental Models | "strategic mental models" | "decision frameworks", "strategic thinking tools" | 200/mo | 30 |

### Step 4: Content Gap Analysis

**Identify opportunities:**
- Keywords competitors rank for that we don't
- Questions being asked that we haven't answered
- Topics with search volume but low competition
- Content types that perform well in our niche

**Example:**
- Competitor ranks for "M&A integration checklist" (500 searches/mo, difficulty 25)
- We don't have content on this topic
- **Opportunity:** Create comprehensive M&A integration guide

## On-Page SEO Optimization

### Page-Level Elements

**1. Title Tag (Most Important)**
- Include primary keyword (front-loaded if possible)
- 50-60 characters ideal
- Compelling, click-worthy
- Unique for each page

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Strategic Consulting for the Intelligence Age | Prismatica Labs"
- ✅ "ESI: Executive Strategic Intelligence Platform | Prismatica"
- ❌ "Home | Prismatica Labs" (no keyword, not descriptive)

**2. Meta Description**
- Include primary keyword
- 150-160 characters
- Clear value proposition
- Call to action

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Prismatica combines AI-augmented consulting with intelligence products. Replace one-time reports with compounding strategic assets. Explore our approach →"
- ❌ "Prismatica Labs offers consulting services to help companies." (vague, no differentiation)

**3. H1 Heading (One per page)**
- Include primary keyword
- Clear, benefit-focused
- Match or closely align with title tag

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Strategic Consulting for the Intelligence Age"
- ✅ "ESI: Turn Strategic Research into Continuous Intelligence"
- ❌ "Welcome to Prismatica" (no keyword, no value prop)

**4. H2/H3 Subheadings**
- Include secondary keywords naturally
- Structure content logically
- Make content scannable

**5. Body Content**
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Secondary keywords throughout (natural, not stuffed)
- Keyword density 1-2% (don't obsess)
- Comprehensive (1,500+ words for competitive keywords)
- Use semantic keywords (related terms Google associates)

**Semantic Keyword Example:**
Primary: "strategic consulting"
Semantic: "strategy consulting", "management consulting", "business strategy", "strategic planning", "strategic advisory"

### Image Optimization

**Alt Text:**
- Describe image content
- Include keyword if relevant and natural
- Don't keyword stuff

**Examples:**
- ✅ "ESI platform dashboard showing competitive intelligence analysis"
- ❌ "strategic consulting AI platform executive intelligence ESI" (keyword stuffing)

**File Names:**
- Descriptive, kebab-case
- Include keyword if relevant

**Examples:**
- ✅ `esi-dashboard-competitive-intelligence.png`
- ❌ `IMG_1234.png`

**File Size:**
- Compress images (use WebP format)
- Lazy load below-the-fold images
- Aim for < 200KB per image

### Internal Linking

**Strategy:**
- Link from high-authority pages to new content
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Create topic clusters (pillar page + supporting content)
- Link related content to keep users engaged

**Example Internal Link Structure:**
```
Homepage
├── Services (pillar)
│   ├── Mental Models
│   ├── Prismatic Analysis
│   └── Agentic Consulting
├── Products (pillar)
│   ├── ESI
│   ├── Agency Intelligence
│   └── KSO
└── Blog (pillar)
    ├── AI in Strategic Consulting
    ├── M&A Integration Frameworks
    └── Executive Decision-Making
```

**Anchor Text Best Practices:**
- ✅ "Learn more about our strategic mental models framework"
- ✅ "Read our comprehensive M&A integration guide"
- ❌ "Click here" (no context for search engines)

### External Linking

**When to Link Out:**
- Citing data or research
- Referencing authoritative sources
- Providing additional resources
- Building relationship with industry leaders

**Best Practices:**
- Link to high-authority domains (.edu, .gov, major publications)
- Use `rel="noopener"` for security
- Don't use `rel="nofollow"` unless necessary (paid links, untrusted content)
- Link naturally in context

## Technical SEO

### Site Structure

**URL Structure:**
- Clean, descriptive URLs
- Include keywords
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Keep short and logical

**Examples:**
- ✅ `prismaticalabs.com/services/mental-models`
- ✅ `prismaticalabs.com/blog/ai-strategic-consulting`
- ❌ `prismaticalabs.com/p=123`
- ❌ `prismaticalabs.com/services/mental_models_strategic_consulting_framework`

**Site Hierarchy:**
```
Homepage
├── /services/
├── /products/
├── /blog/
├── /case-studies/
├── /about/
└── /contact/
```

Keep important pages 2-3 clicks from homepage.

### Page Speed Optimization

**Critical for SEO and UX:**
- Target: < 3 seconds load time
- Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID, CLS (Google ranking factors)

**Optimizations:**
- Compress images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Minify CSS/JS
- Use CDN (Vercel handles this)
- Reduce server response time
- Eliminate render-blocking resources

**Test with:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest

### Mobile Optimization

**Mobile-First Indexing:**
Google primarily uses mobile version for ranking.

**Requirements:**
- Responsive design (Prismatica already handles this)
- Touch-friendly buttons (44x44px minimum)
- Readable text without zooming (16px minimum)
- No horizontal scrolling
- Fast mobile load time

**Test:**
- Google Mobile-Friendly Test
- Test on actual devices (iOS, Android)

### Structured Data (Schema Markup)

**Implement for:**

- **Product Schema:** For ESI, Agency Intelligence, etc.
- **FAQ Schema:** FAQ pages (show in search results)
- **BreadcrumbList Schema:** Navigation breadcrumbs

**Example (Organization):**

  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Prismatica Labs",
  "url": "https://prismaticalabs.com",
  "logo": "https://prismaticalabs.com/logo.png",
  "description": "Strategic consulting for the intelligence age",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.linkedin.com/company/prismatica-labs",
    "https://twitter.com/prismaticalabs"
  ]
}
```

### XML Sitemap

**Ensure:**
- All important pages included

- No broken links or redirects in sitemap

### Robots.txt

**Allow:**
