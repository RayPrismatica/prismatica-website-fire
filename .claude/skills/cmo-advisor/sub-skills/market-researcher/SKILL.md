## Remember

Research is only valuable if it drives action.

Every research activity should answer:
1. What decision does this inform?
2. What will we do differently based on findings?
3. How does this support strategic objectives?

Focus on:
- **Actionable insights**, not just data
- **Strategic implications**, not just facts
- **Differentiation opportunities**, not just gaps
- **Evidence-based recommendations**, not assumptions
