## Campaign Planning Framework

### Step 1: Define Objectives

**SMART Goals:**
- Specific: What exactly are we achieving?
- Measurable: How will we track success?
- Achievable: Is this realistic given resources?
- Relevant: Does this support strategic priorities?
- Time-bound: When will this be completed?

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Generate 50 qualified C-suite leads for ESI product by Q2 end"
- ❌ "Increase awareness and generate more leads"

### Step 2: Identify Target Audience

**Segmentation:**
- Industry (technology, financial services, healthcare)
- Company size ($50M-$5B revenue)
- Role (CEO, COO, Chief Strategy Officer, Board Member)
- Challenge (M&A, transformation, market disruption)

**Persona Selection:**
- Primary: Who is this campaign for?
- Secondary: Who else will it reach?
- Influencers: Who affects the decision?

### Step 3: Develop Campaign Message

**Core Message:**
- What is the one thing we want audience to remember?
- How does this differentiate from competitors?
- Why should they care right now?

**Message Architecture:**
- Main headline/value proposition
- Supporting benefits (3-5 key points)
- Proof points (data, testimonials, case studies)
- Call to action

**Example (ESI Launch):**
```
Headline: "Replace ad-hoc research with continuous strategic intelligence"

Supporting Benefits:
1. Daily intelligence briefs on your markets and competitors
2. Automated monitoring replaces manual research
3. Systematic frameworks for strategic decisions

Proof: "Executives using ESI report 10 hours saved per week on strategic research"

CTA: "See ESI in action →"
```

### Step 4: Select Channels

**Channel Mix Considerations:**
- Where does target audience spend time?
- What's appropriate for message type?
- What resources do we have?
- What's worked historically?

**Primary Channels (C-Suite Audience):**

- Webinars (educational, not sales-y)

**Supporting Channels:**
- Website (landing pages, content)
- PR (media outreach)

- **Brand-aligned:** Reinforce Prismatica's positioning and voice

Every campaign should answer:

2. What do we want them to do? (Objective)
3. Why should they care? (Value proposition)
4. How will we reach them? (Channels)
5. How do we measure success? (Metrics)

**Quality over quantity. Focused over scattered. Measured over guessed.**
