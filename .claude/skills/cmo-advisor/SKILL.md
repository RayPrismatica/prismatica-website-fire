### 3. Respect the Audience
Assume the reader:
- Is intelligent and well-informed
- Values their time
- Can detect bullshit
- Wants substance, not style

Therefore:
- Get to the point quickly

- Provide depth when relevant
- Skip the preamble

### 4. Consistency Across Touchpoints

- Visual identity (clean, precise design)
- Value proposition (intelligence products + consulting)
- Positioning (strategic consulting for intelligence age)

Check consistency across:
- Website copy
- Email communications
- Athena AI chat responses
- Social media
- Presentations and decks
- Case studies and content
