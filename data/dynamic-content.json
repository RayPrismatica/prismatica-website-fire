    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small modular nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone sees energy security. We see something else entirely. When countries start building localised power generation at scale, that's not infrastructure planning. That's deglobalisation wearing a hard hat.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which supply chains are nations quietly onshoring while everyone debates tariffs?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's geopolitical risk frameworks help multinationals navigate trade tensions. Brilliant analysis, decades of cross-border expertise refined. But what if that calibre of strategic foresight wasn't limited to seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access how the smartest money reads global shifts?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear pivot signalling deglobalisation, and the What We Do page wondered which supply chains nations are quietly onshoring?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four boards asked us about \"sovereign capability\" strategies. That's the UK nuclear story playing out everywhere before it hits quarterly reports.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations building their own power sources never have to explain their independence?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas campaign while Tesco goes episodic storytelling. Both spending millions to differentiate identical turkeys. The real pattern? Neither can articulate why they exist beyond \"selling groceries profitably.\" We dissect your actual reason to exist, then cascade that purpose through every decision criterion and customer touchpoint. Inside-out authenticity that makes both culture and messaging coherent. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign theme.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebranding itself as a startup while carrying decades of organisational debt. Classic insight-execution canyon. Everyone knows the vision, nobody knows how to get there from here. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for that exact gap. Explore surfaces the real constraints, Synthesise turns findings into executable pathways, Ignite makes change actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop from discovery to done.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports most companies are one resignation away from leadership crisis. Translation: your best people are burnt out and shopping their CVs. We work with executives who realised their 70-hour weeks include 30 hours of performative presence and 10 hours of actual thinking. Secret Agency helps high-performers distinguish motion from progress. Because optimising for visibility when you need clarity is how empires quietly crumble.",
    "ksoDescription": "Microsoft and Anthropic just announced AI data centres while ChatGPT crosses 200M weekly users. Traditional SEO optimises for an evaporating game. KSO Workshop maps your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI systems actually parse and cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when AI answers customer questions, your Google rankings become archaeological artifacts.",
    "transactionDescription": "Dua Lipa and Coldplay demanding faster action on ticket touts who fleece fans. Perfect metaphor. The tickets have value, the artists have appeal, but parasites capture the actual transaction. Transaction Architecture maps the real value exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive understanding, and behavioural triggers. Then designs every touchpoint to complete those exchanges, not leak them. Deep truth meeting surface appeal, systematically.",
    "triptychDescription": "Citizens Bank closing branches while digital adoption soars. Textbook case of strong capabilities missing the obvious. Physical locations optimised perfectly, digital experience built brilliantly, nobody asked if customers still wanted branches. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. The expensive mistakes always hide between those lenses. The breakthrough opportunities too.\n"
