    "newsInsight": "UK just approved its first small nuclear reactor site in north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon neutrality timelines. Nobody's asking the real question. If modular reactors finally crack distributed energy, what happens to every business model built on centralised power grids?",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which industries collapse when energy becomes hyper-local and which ones suddenly become viable?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest energy transition framework helps utilities navigate the shift to renewables. Brilliant analysis, decades of sector expertise. But what if that calibre of strategic foresight wasn't reserved for energy giants? What if every business could access frameworks for navigating their own disruptions?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear approval disrupting energy grids, and the What We Do page wondered which industries collapse when power goes local?",
    "marketObservation": "Right now we're watching three sectors quietly restructure around distributed energy assumptions while everyone else debates carbon targets.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the companies thriving through energy transitions already answered 'why we exist' without mentioning kilowatts or margins?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a star-studded Christmas campaign while their actual problem is nobody knows why Waitrose exists beyond 'posh Tesco.' Marketing can't fix what purpose hasn't defined. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then engineer it into every decision criterion and customer touchpoint. Inside-out authenticity where operations and messaging align. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign theme.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebranding as a startup while their content strategy stays exactly the same. Classic insight-execution gap. Everyone knows the problem, nobody has infrastructure to fix it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for making discovery actionable. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise converts insights to executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three consulting phases. One continuous transformation engine.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports a humanoid robot fell on its face during debut. Meanwhile executives everywhere performing their own face-plants attempting to look productive instead of being strategic. We work with leaders drowning in performance theatre who've forgotten what actual performance feels like. Secret Agency: where burnt-out high-achievers rediscover the difference between motion and progress. Because your 70-hour weeks producing 30 hours of value isn't dedication. It's dysfunction.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports Anthropic and Microsoft building AI data centres while marketers still optimise for Google's dying algorithm. AI doesn't crawl websites, it indexes knowledge. KSO Workshop: we transform your expertise into knowledge graphs AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks from SEO-searchable to AI-authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, page-one Google rankings become worthless.",
    "transactionDescription": "Unilever discovered creators drive more trust than brands but can't figure out why. They're measuring reach when they should map value exchange. Transaction Architecture: we decode the actual spiritual, cognitive and tangible triggers that convert browsers to believers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Because optimising surface metrics while missing deep value exchange just creates expensive noise.",
    "triptychDescription": "Prime Video hits 315 million viewers but advertisers flee because engagement doesn't equal effectiveness. Strong product, massive reach, dying revenues. Classic gap problem. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do your biggest opportunities. Most leaders sense something's off but examine one dimension at a time. We show you all three at once.\n"
