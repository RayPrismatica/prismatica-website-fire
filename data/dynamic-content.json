    "newsInsight": "UK growth just slowed after car production collapsed 30%. Everyone's blaming supply chains. Wrong variable. When your economy needs one industry to prop up GDP, that's not a production problem. That's a diversification crisis wearing a manufacturing costume.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK growth slowdown, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if 30% of your growth vanishes with one industry hiccup, were you ever actually growing or just getting really good at building cars?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate complexity with surgical precision. Decades of refinement, battle-tested across continents. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious leader could access it when they need it most?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's growth crisis hiding in car production data, and the What We Do page wondered if they were measuring growth or just assembly lines?",
    "marketObservation": "This week we're watching markets panic about UK growth while missing the pattern: economies built on single industries always look brilliant until Tuesday.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the UK can't explain why car manufacturing matters beyond \"jobs and exports\"?",
    "serviceDescription": "Premier Foods just admitted their growth strategy is \"put our brands on more shelves\" because they never defined what those brands actually mean to anyone. Watch companies everywhere realise their \"brand values\" are just adjectives they liked. We dissect why your business exists beyond the revenue model, then engineer that purpose into every hiring decision, product choice, and customer interaction. Inside-out authenticity that creates both culture and competitive advantage. Purpose as decision filter, not mission statement.",
    "esiDescription": "Vitality smashed insurance sales targets by actually understanding what customers buy (peace of mind) versus what insurers sell (risk pooling). Most strategies die in that gap. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for connecting insight to impact. Explore uncovers what's actually true, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that closes the knowing-doing gap.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports AI adoption fails most when C-suite leaders delegate it downward because they're \"too busy\" to understand it themselves. Classic high-performer trap. Secret Agency works with executives who realise their 70-hour weeks are 20 hours of value creation and 50 hours of sophisticated wheel-spinning. We help you optimise for leverage, not motion. Because the most dangerous inefficiency is efficient busywork.",
    "ksoDescription": "Wired reveals OpenAI models heading to US military while most brands still optimise for Google's dying algorithm. Traditional SEO assumes people search. KSO assumes AI answers. We map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI systems actually cite and reference. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when ChatGPT explains your industry, ranking on Google becomes quaint.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week shows B2B brands using AI as \"creative sparring partner\" while missing why their campaigns don't convert. They're optimising creative when they should map value exchange. Transaction Architecture reveals how decisions actually happen across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then we engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep behavioural truth meets surface appeal. Conversion through understanding, not manipulation.",
    "triptychDescription": "Forbes reports Pentagon acquiring \"multi-dimensional drone swarms\" they could've had five years ago if procurement, strategy, and operations talked. Classic blind spot. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, how you compete, and how you execute simultaneously. Because most million-pound problems hide between departments. Most breakthrough opportunities too. See the whole system or optimise the wrong part.\n"
