    "newsInsight": "Arctic blast hits UK just as flood cleanup begins. Nature's timing is perfect. Markets panic about weather patterns whilst smart money realises infrastructure spending just became politically inevitable. Sometimes crisis creates clarity.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK Arctic blast amid flooding, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which construction stocks are quietly loading up on emergency response contracts before Parliament notices the infrastructure gap?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's Crisis Response Framework helps governments navigate natural disasters with surgical precision. Decades of pattern recognition distilled into actionable playbooks. But imagine if that calibre of strategic foresight was accessible before the crisis hit, not after.",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's Arctic blast hitting during flood cleanup, and the What We Do page wondered which construction stocks were positioning for the infrastructure boom?",
    "marketObservation": "This week we're watching infrastructure plays move before policy announcements. The Arctic blast meeting flood damage isn't weather coincidence. It's the market's way of pricing in £50 billion of inevitable spending before Westminster admits it.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations that thrived through COVID already knew their answer to 'why we exist beyond revenue'?",
    "serviceDescription": "Yeti just hired their first ad agency after 20 years of organic growth. Classic symptom: when you can't explain why customers pay 5x for a cooler, you hire someone to invent a reason. We excavate the actual reason your premium exists, then architect that truth through every customer touchpoint and internal decision. Purpose as navigation system, not navigation excuse. Because authentic premium beats manufactured positioning every time.",
    "esiDescription": "Ford just unveiled a massive new headquarters for their 'ambitious new era'. Everyone sees optimism. We see the insight-execution gap: brilliant vision presentations that become real estate projects. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that gap. Explore finds the strategic truth, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes ambition operational. Because transformation isn't about new buildings. It's about new behaviours.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports how emotionally intelligent people use stress to optimise performance. Meanwhile, every founder we know is optimising for stress, not through it. Secret Agency: where high-performers untangle effectiveness from exhaustion. We work with executives who've mistaken inbox zero for impact and 70-hour weeks for 40 hours of value. Strategic clarity over reactive velocity. Because peak performance and burnout aren't supposed to feel the same.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company warns AI is killing privacy. More urgent: it's killing discoverability. Traditional SEO assumes people search. But when ChatGPT answers questions, being on page one means nothing if AI never cites you. KSO Workshop: we map your expertise into knowledge structures AI actually understands and references. Four weeks to shift from searchable to citable. Because authority in the AI era isn't about ranking. It's about being the source AI trusts.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week reports John Lewis's Christmas ad testing well with consumers. Surface appeal confirmed. But Burberry's 'brand desirability' returned growth after two years by understanding deeper value exchange. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people actually transact beyond surface response. Mapping emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers that turn interest into investment. Because great creative without transaction architecture just wins awards, not customers.",
    "triptychDescription": "Premier Foods expands into new categories whilst emphasising 'brand importance'. Classic blindspot: strong brand, clear product strategy, but nobody checked if their supply chain could handle category proliferation. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Most failures hide where functions don't talk. Like Premier learning brand strength can't overcome operational gaps. Simultaneous diagnosis reveals what sequential analysis always misses.\n"
