    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon credits. We're watching something else entirely. When governments start building their own energy infrastructure instead of outsourcing it, that's not climate policy. That's sovereignty returning.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other \"efficiency plays\" are actually independence moves wearing market costume?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation playbooks have 97% implementation rates for Fortune 500s. Absolutely world class methodology, refined over decades. But what if that calibre of strategic rigour wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious leadership team could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear sovereignty play, and the What We Do page wondered which efficiency moves are really independence moves?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone we've fielded five calls about \"energy strategy\" that were really about supply chain independence. The smartest money isn't optimising for cost anymore. It's optimising for control.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the companies thriving through supply shocks already answered 'why we exist' without mentioning shareholder returns?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just rebranded itself as a startup while most legacy media clings to yesterday's playbook. Watch established brands everywhere realise their \"heritage\" is actually handcuffs. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then architect that purpose into every decision filter and customer touchpoint. Not another rebrand. A systematic rewiring of why you matter. Purpose as operating system, not press release.",
    "esiDescription": "Citizens Bank shuttered 14 branches citing \"digital transformation\" but never connected customer research to closure strategy. Classic insight-to-execution canyon. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our method for bridging that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually moves. One continuous loop, not three separate consultant invoices.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports most companies are \"one resignation away from leadership crisis\" because executives confuse indispensability with effectiveness. Sound familiar? We work with CEOs who've built elaborate systems ensuring nothing happens without them. Secret Agency: where successful leaders learn the difference between being needed and being valuable. Because your 80-hour weeks creating 40 hours of bottlenecks isn't leadership. It's expensive theatre.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports work jargon infiltrating romance because that's where attention lives now. Meanwhile your SEO team still optimises for Google while everyone asks ChatGPT. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually understands and cites. Four weeks to shift from searchable to citeable. Because when AI answers your market's questions, page one rankings become yesterday's metric.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose debuts cinematic Christmas adverts while Tesco counters with episodic storytelling. Both missing the point: people don't buy stories, they buy value exchanges. Transaction Architecture maps how decisions actually happen across emotional triggers, comprehension shifts, and action catalysts. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those exchanges. Pretty campaigns without purchase architecture just win awards, not customers.",
    "triptychDescription": "Marketing Week reveals brands trust creators more than themselves, Unilever mixing influencers with \"marketing science.\" Classic symptom of deeper misalignment. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Because your marketing team hiring creators while product ignores creator needs while strategy pretends creators don't exist? That gap is where value dies.\n"
