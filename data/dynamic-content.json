    "newsInsight": "UK just announced five young people dead in a two-car crash. Everyone sees tragedy. We see something else. When accidents spike precisely as companies mandate return-to-office, that's not coincidence. That's exhausted workers making deadly commutes they haven't done in years.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK crash story, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: how many \"accidents\" are really just the physics of forcing night owls into morning commutes?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's new hybrid work framework helps Fortune 500s navigate office policies. Brilliant analysis, decades of organisational psychology. But imagine if that calibre of insight helped companies see the human cost of their decisions before the headlines hit?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed those UK crash deaths linking to return-to-office mandates, and the What We Do page wondered about night owls forced into morning commutes?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three CEOs asked us about \"productivity\" while their best people quit over commute requirements. The pattern isn't subtle anymore.",
    "purposeContext": "Right now companies losing talent can't explain why flexibility matters beyond \"people want it.\"",
    "serviceDescription": "Yeti just hired their first ad agency after decades of word-of-mouth growth. Watch brands everywhere panic about losing organic momentum. We excavate why your business actually exists, then engineer that truth into every decision and customer touchpoint. No more choosing between authenticity and growth. Purpose as navigation system, not nostalgia.",
    "esiDescription": "Ford's massive new HQ shows they're betting big on \"collaborative innovation\" without defining what that means. Classic insight-to-execution canyon. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our framework for crossing it. Explore reveals the real opportunity, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three engagements. One system.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports 9 behaviours of bad bosses, but missed the tenth: good bosses acting like bad ones because they're drowning. We work with executives who've optimised everything except their own effectiveness. Secret Agency: where leaders learn the difference between performing leadership and actually leading. Because your 70-hour weeks are producing 30 hours of value.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company notes résumé metrics predict interviews, but AI's changing what \"findable\" means. Google ranks pages, AI cites knowledge. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into structures AI systems actually reference. Four weeks to transform from searchable to citeable. Because when ChatGPT answers questions, your SEO strategy is worthless.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week celebrates John Lewis's Christmas ad testing well, but early favourites rarely drive late December sales. They optimised for hearts, not wallets. Transaction Architecture: we decode the emotional, cognitive and behavioral triggers that turn appeal into action. Map the value exchange, not just the value prop. Because delight without transaction design is just expensive entertainment.",
    "triptychDescription": "Premier Foods expanded categories while Burberry struggled despite \"brand desirability.\" One saw system opportunities, one optimised in isolation. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Problems hide between functions. So do your biggest opportunities. Most companies never look there.\n"
