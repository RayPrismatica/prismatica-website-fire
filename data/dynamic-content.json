    "newsInsight": "UK just revealed treasure finds hit record highs this year. Everyone's digging for gold in their gardens. Meanwhile businesses are sitting on intellectual assets they've never catalogued, wondering why AI never cites them.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK treasure finds, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: how many companies are sitting on knowledge goldmines they've never mapped because they're still optimising for Google instead of AI?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading about BCG's digital transformation frameworks that help Fortune 500s navigate complexity. Brilliant systematic thinking refined over decades. But what if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious team could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's record treasure finds, and the What We Do page wondered about companies sitting on unmapped knowledge goldmines?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four CEOs asked us why their brands rank first on Google but never appear in ChatGPT responses. That's the market discovering what we've been saying: authority just shifted from links to knowledge.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations thriving now already mapped their intellectual territory before AI made it matter?",
    "serviceDescription": "Citizens Bank is closing branches across seven states while wondering why digital adoption isn't filling the gap. Watch organisations everywhere realise their 'customer experience' never actually asked why customers came in the first place. We dissect the actual reason your business exists beyond quarterly earnings, then engineer that purpose into every channel decision and customer touchpoint. Inside-out authenticity that makes branch closures strategic, not desperate. Purpose as navigation system, not nostalgia.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC just rebranded itself as a startup, proving even legacy media knows transformation theatre from actual change. Everyone applauds the new logo while the operating model stays frozen. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for making bold moves actually move. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise turns findings into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy kinetic. Not another rebrand that changes nothing. An operating system that changes everything.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Warren Buffett just shared his three success lessons: focus, patience, and saying no. Meanwhile executives everywhere are drowning in opportunities they can't refuse. We work with leaders who realise their 70-hour weeks are 20 hours of value creation and 50 hours of elaborate performance art. Secret Agency: where high-performers relearn the multiplication of subtraction. Because Buffett didn't build Berkshire by attending every meeting invitation.",
    "ksoDescription": "Microsoft and Anthropic just announced massive AI data centres in three states. Traditional SEO experts are still arguing about meta tags. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge graphs these new AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to citeable. Because when AI becomes the primary discovery layer, page rankings become archaeological relics.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco went episodic. Both spent millions on emotional storytelling, neither asked what actually triggers the weekly shop switch. Transaction Architecture: we decode the three-dimensional value exchange beneath purchase decisions. Map the emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and tangible triggers that turn consideration into conversion. Because great creative without transaction design is just expensive entertainment.",
    "triptychDescription": "Prime Video hit 315 million monthly viewers but can't explain why some shows convert to subscriptions while others just burn bandwidth. Classic symptom of excellence in isolation. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. The real problems live where marketing promises what product can't deliver and strategy ignores what competition already knows. Most businesses optimise parts while the system decays.\n"
