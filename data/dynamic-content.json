    "newsInsight": "UK just announced military examiners for driving tests to clear backlogs. Everyone's talking efficiency. We see something else. When governments deploy military precision to civilian problems, they're not fixing systems. They're admitting the systems are broken beyond civilian repair.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK military driving test news, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other civilian services are one crisis away from needing military intervention, and what does that tell us about infrastructure investment priorities?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey helps organizations design digital transformations that take 18 months to implement. Brilliant frameworks, tested across industries. But what if transformation thinking could happen in real time? What if strategy evolved as fast as markets move?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's military fixing driving test backlogs, and the What We Do page wondered which other civilian services might need military rescue next?\n"
