    "newsInsight": "NYT reports new Epstein emails allegedly show Trump knew of his conduct. Everyone's shocked. Really? Power protects power until the cameras arrive. The real question is which current billionaire friendships we'll be shocked about in 2034.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Epstein emails, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which current billionaire \"eccentricities\" are being rationalized right now by people who'll claim ignorance later?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey helps boards navigate reputational crises with their legendary risk frameworks. Brilliant work, saves fortunes. But imagine if that level of strategic foresight was accessible before the crisis, not just after.",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed those Epstein emails about Trump, and the What We Do page wondered which current billionaire behaviors we're ignoring?\n"
