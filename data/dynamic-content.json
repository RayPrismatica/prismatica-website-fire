    "newsInsight": "UK just reported growth slowing after car production plummeted. Everyone blames Brexit and supply chains. We see something else. When luxury car makers cut production but profit margins rise, that's not recession planning. That's scarcity engineering at industrial scale.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK car production collapse, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: are manufacturers discovering they make more money building fewer cars, and what happens when every industry realises this?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate disruption with military precision. Decades of pattern recognition distilled into repeatable excellence. But imagine if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers. What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK car production collapsing while profits rise, and the What We Do page wondered if scarcity engineering is the new business model?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three different CEOs asked us about \"strategic production cuts\" after seeing automotive profit margins rise despite lower output. The smart money's already copying the playbook.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how car makers cutting production by 30% are posting record profits while explaining it as \"supply chain issues\"?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a star-studded Christmas campaign while Tesco fights on price. One knows exactly why they exist, the other just knows they need to sell groceries. We excavate your actual reason for being, then engineer it into every decision filter and customer touchpoint. Purpose as operating system, not Christmas creative. Because when markets shift, companies with clear identity pivot while others just panic.",
    "esiDescription": "Vitality smashed insurance targets by reimagining the entire category, but most insurers still can't execute on insights they've had for years. Classic case: brilliant discovery, zero follow-through. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that gap. Explore reveals truth, Synthesise turns insight into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that turns knowing into doing.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports fit people's brains are literally built differently. No surprise there. We work with CEOs who've optimised everything except the organ doing the optimising. Secret Agency: where executives learn their 14-hour days are mostly expensive performance art. Strategic thinking requires strategic recovery. But you already knew that. You just needed permission to act on it.",
    "ksoDescription": "OpenAI's releasing GPT-5.1 this month with \"fewer hallucinations and better creative writing.\" Meanwhile, your SEO team's still optimising for an algorithm that's becoming irrelevant. KSO Workshop: we transform your expertise into knowledge structures AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to shift from keyword rankings to intellectual authority. Because when AI answers every question, being findable on Google means nothing if AI never mentions you.",
    "transactionDescription": "B2B brands are using AI as a \"creative sparring partner\" but still can't explain why deals die at 80% close. They're optimising creative while ignoring the actual value architecture. Transaction Architecture maps how decisions really happen across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those exchanges. Deep psychological alignment, not surface-level split tests.",
    "triptychDescription": "Pentagon just acquired a \"multi-dimensional drone swarm\" that works because every unit sees the whole battlefield simultaneously. Meanwhile, your marketing team has no idea what product's building next quarter. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute as one system. Because your biggest problems aren't in any department. They're in the gaps between them."
