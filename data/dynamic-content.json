    "newsInsight": "UK's first small nuclear reactor just got greenlit in Wales. Everyone's debating clean energy versus local protests. We're watching something else entirely. When governments start approving infrastructure that takes 15 years to build, they're telling you what currency matters in 2040.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear approval, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which resource becomes the new oil when compute power determines GDP?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest transformation framework helps CEOs navigate complexity with military precision. Decades of refinement, battle-tested across Fortune 500s. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear approval signalling 2040's power currency, and the What We Do page wondered which resource becomes the new oil?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three different CEOs asked us about energy infrastructure investments. Not for ESG points. They're seeing what the UK nuclear approval really signals: compute-intensive businesses will relocate based on power availability.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how countries approving 15-year infrastructure projects already know their answer to 'why do we exist beyond GDP growth?'",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just rebranded and called it \"embracing startup ethos\" but can't explain what that actually means beyond new graphics. Watch every legacy brand scramble to define \"transformation\" while their teams pull in twelve different directions. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then engineer that truth into every hire, decision, and customer touchpoint. Purpose as operating system that aligns energy instead of dispersing it. Because \"startup ethos\" without foundational clarity is just expensive chaos.",
    "esiDescription": "Anthropic and Microsoft announced massive data centre projects but neither explained how they'll actually integrate their teams, cultures, or conflicting AI philosophies. Classic pattern: infrastructure before integration. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our systematic approach to bridging strategy and execution. Explore surfaces the real tensions, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite ensures momentum survives contact with reality. Transformation as repeatable process, not heroic one-off.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Warren Buffett sharing \"3 lessons for success\" while working until 94 and calling it balance. Sound familiar? We work with executives who've optimised everything except their own operating system. Secret Agency: where high-performers realise 80-hour weeks producing 40 hours of value isn't dedication, it's poor system design. Stop confusing motion with progress.",
    "ksoDescription": "Prime Video hit 315 million monthly viewers while traditional SEO metrics become increasingly meaningless. Here's what matters: when someone asks AI about streaming innovation, does it cite Netflix or Prime? KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory so AI systems recognise and reference your authority. Four weeks to shift from keyword rankings to knowledge ownership. Because being findable on Google means nothing if AI never mentions you exist.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose dropped a rom-com Christmas ad with zero connection to why people actually choose them over Tesco. Beautiful production, emotional appeal, but missing the actual value exchange that drives premium grocery decisions. Transaction Architecture: we decode the three-dimensional decision process behind every purchase. Emotional resonance meets rational justification meets behavioural triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete that specific transaction. Because great creative without transaction design is just expensive entertainment.",
    "triptychDescription": "Citizens Bank closing branches while their digital team builds features nobody requested. Classic symptoms of strategic misalignment: operations cuts costs, digital adds complexity, nobody asks if the strategy still makes sense. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do your biggest opportunities. See the whole system at once, not just the parts reporting to you.\n"
