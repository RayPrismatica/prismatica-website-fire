    "newsInsight": "NYT reports Trump knew about Epstein's conduct according to new emails. Everyone's focused on the scandal. We see something else. When billionaires protect predators, it's not friendship. It's portfolio insurance. The real story? What other liabilities are hiding in plain sight.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Trump-Epstein emails, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if powerful people knowingly shield criminal behavior, what does that say about the due diligence standards of their business partners and investors?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey helps companies navigate reputational crises with their legendary risk frameworks. Absolutely brilliant methodology, honed over decades. But what if that level of strategic insight wasn't just for damage control after the fact? What if every leadership team could spot these patterns before they explode?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed those Trump-Epstein emails, and the What We Do page wondered about due diligence standards among the ultra-wealthy?\n"
