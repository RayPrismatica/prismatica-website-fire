    "newsInsight": "NYT reports Trump's treasury pick Scott Bessent used the exact tax dodge the IRS tried to block. Everyone's screaming hypocrisy. Wrong lens. When your treasury secretary knows every loophole personally, that's either your biggest risk or your secret weapon.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Bessent tax story, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: If your treasury secretary personally exploited every loophole, does that make them the worst guardian or the only one who actually knows what to guard?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey helps CEOs navigate regulatory complexity with their legendary frameworks. Decades of pattern recognition, unmatched rigor. But imagine if that level of strategic insight wasn't just for Fortune 100 boardrooms. What if every ambitious leader could tap that thinking?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Bessent's tax dodge revelation, and the What We Do page wondered if that makes him the worst guardian or the best?\n"
