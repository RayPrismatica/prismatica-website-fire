    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small modular nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone sees energy independence. We see the real story. When a nation bets its grid on untested tech at scale, that's not energy strategy. That's venture capital thinking with public money.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which construction delays will hit first, the technical ones or the regulatory ones, and who's actually underwriting that risk?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate massive operational shifts with surgical precision. Brilliant methodology, battle-tested across decades. But imagine if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers. What if every ambitious team could access frameworks that actually work?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear bet as venture capital with public money, and the What We Do page wondered who's actually carrying the construction risk?",
    "marketObservation": "Right now we're watching governments make infrastructure bets that would terrify any rational investor, yet markets barely flinch. That disconnect tells us risk models haven't caught up to political reality.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how nations announcing grand energy strategies can't answer 'what happens when this goes 20% over budget' without changing the subject?",
    "serviceDescription": "Cheez-It wants to become the UK's 'next iconic brand' while Waitrose drops star-studded Christmas ads. One knows exactly why they exist, the other hopes expensive celebrities will tell them. We dissect your actual reason to exist, then engineer that purpose into every decision criterion and customer touchpoint. Inside-out authenticity that makes both teams and markets believe. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebranding with 'startup ethos' while their parent company can't explain what that actually means operationally. Classic insight-to-execution canyon. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that gap. Explore surfaces the real opportunity, Synthesise turns discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes transformation actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that turns knowing into doing.",
    "agencyDescription": "Jack Schlossberg just announced he's running for office while juggling law, media, and family legacy. Another high-achiever who thinks adding responsibilities equals progress. We work with leaders who've optimised themselves into exhaustion. Secret Agency: where executives learn the difference between motion and momentum. Because at some point, saying yes to everything becomes saying no to impact.",
    "ksoDescription": "Anthropic and Microsoft just announced massive AI data centres while most brands still optimise for Google's dying algorithm. Traditional SEO assumes people search. AI assumes they ask. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory so AI systems cite you as the authority. Four weeks to shift from searchable to essential. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, page rankings become yesterday's metric.",
    "transactionDescription": "Prime Video hits 315 million viewers but can't explain why half skip the ads they paid to watch. Surface metrics without understanding the actual value exchange. Transaction Architecture maps how decisions really happen across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Because measuring eyeballs when you need conversions is like counting clouds when you need rain.",
    "triptychDescription": "Unilever trusts creators more than their own brand teams while marketing claims they follow 'marketing science'. Perfect example of strategy saying one thing while operations do another. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do your biggest opportunities. Sometimes the diagnosis is more valuable than the cure.\n"
