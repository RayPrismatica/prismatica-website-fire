    "newsInsight": "UK just approved its first small nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone's debating clean energy. We're watching something else. When governments fast-track infrastructure that usually takes decades, they're not solving today's problems. They're solving Tuesday's crisis.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear approval, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which critical resource scarcity are they modelling that hasn't hit headlines yet?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate complexity with surgical precision. Decades of pattern recognition distilled into proprietary methods. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious team could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear fast-track, and the What We Do page wondered what resource scarcity they're modelling?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three CEOs asked us about supply chain resilience completely unprompted. When nuclear approvals accelerate globally while executives worry about resources, that's tomorrow's constraint signalling today.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how governments preparing for resource scarcity can't explain it without causing panic?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco embraces \"perfectly imperfect\" storytelling. Both brilliant tactics serving... what exactly? When your marketing team can't articulate why you exist beyond quarterly targets, every campaign becomes expensive performance art. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then architect that purpose into every decision filter, cultural norm, and customer promise. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign.",
    "esiDescription": "B2B brands are using AI as a \"creative sparring partner\" while missing the strategic questions AI should answer first. Everyone's optimising prompts when they should be optimising problems. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for turning discovery into momentum. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise transforms insights into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy move through your organisation. Not another deck. An operating system for continuous transformation.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports 86,149 people studied show learning languages literally reverses aging. Meanwhile executives can't learn to delegate. We work with founders drowning in decisions they trained their teams not to make. Secret Agency: where high-performers discover which patterns that got them here won't get them there. Because optimising for inbox zero when you should optimise for strategic clarity ages you faster than time.",
    "ksoDescription": "OpenAI rumoured to release GPT-5.1 with \"fewer hallucinations and better creative writing.\" Traditional SEO teams still optimising for keywords while AI systems build knowledge graphs. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into structures AI actually understands and cites. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when customers ask AI for recommendations, page one of Google becomes irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week explores how \"joy\" drives purchasing in uncertain times. Yet most conversion strategies still push features and fear. Transaction Architecture maps the actual value exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive understanding, and tangible triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions naturally. Deep human truth meets surface execution. Because people buy transformation, not specifications.",
    "triptychDescription": "Disney and YouTube TV holding customers hostage in carriage disputes while both lose to Netflix. Classic case of competing on yesterday's battlefield. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Most strategic failures hide where those three perspectives don't align. Most breakthrough opportunities too.\n"
