    "newsInsight": "NYT just exposed how Trump's Treasury pick still uses the exact tax dodge the IRS tried banning. Every politician promises to close loopholes. Then picks the guy who perfected them. Maybe that's the qualification.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "Bessent's tax dodge story, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if the best person to close loopholes is the one who used them, why do compliance departments never hire hackers?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest framework revolutionizes organizational design through AI integration. Absolutely brilliant synthesis of behavioral economics and machine learning. But what if that level of strategic thinking wasn't just for companies with nine figure budgets?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Trump's Treasury pick using banned tax dodges, and the What We Do page wondered why compliance teams never hire hackers?\n"
