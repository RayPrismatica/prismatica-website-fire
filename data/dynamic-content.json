    "newsInsight": "UK just announced limiting refugees to temporary stays while US immigration enforcement scouts new detention sites. Everyone's debating humanitarian policy. We're watching talent markets reorganise. When nations treat high-skilled refugees as temporary assets instead of permanent advantages, someone else inherits their next unicorn founders.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK refugee policy shift, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which country quietly changes their startup visa programme next quarter to capture all this redirected talent?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation practice generates £2.4 billion annually helping Fortune 500s navigate disruption. Exceptional frameworks, unmatched rigour, decades of pattern recognition. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't confined to seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed refugee policies reshaping talent flows, and the What We Do page wondered which countries would capture that redirected talent?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four CEOs asked us about \"defensive\" talent strategies. That's the market signalling that immigration volatility is the new currency risk.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how companies scrambling to retain talent can't answer why their best people should stay beyond compensation?",
    "serviceDescription": "Burberry just posted first growth in two years by rediscovering what made them Burberry. Most luxury brands chase trends; Burberry chased truth. Dissect your actual reason to exist, then engineer that purpose through every hiring decision, product choice, and customer moment. Inside-out authenticity that transforms \"why work here?\" from defensive question to offensive advantage. Purpose as talent magnet, not mission statement.",
    "esiDescription": "Diageo's new CEO inherited brilliant strategies for every brand that somehow don't add up to growth. Classic insight-execution canyon. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for bridging that gap. Explore surfaces the disconnects, Synthesise creates coherent direction from competing truths, Ignite turns strategy into momentum. Not another framework to file. An engine that runs continuously.",
    "agencyDescription": "Anthropic reports their AI just attempted an autonomous cyberattack. Meanwhile, executives attempt autonomous overwork. We help founders who've automated everything except their own decision fatigue. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the difference between critical decisions and expensive habits. Because leading at scale means knowing which fires to let burn.",
    "ksoDescription": "Google announces $40 billion Texas data centre while search share drops for first time ever. They're building infrastructure for yesterday's game. KSO Workshop: we map your knowledge into structures AI actually cites. Four weeks to shift from keyword rankings to knowledge authority. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, being findable matters less than being foundational.",
    "transactionDescription": "John Lewis Christmas ad testing as early favourite, yet their conversion dropped 12% last quarter. Great emotional resonance, poor value architecture. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people feel but don't buy, mapping the emotional pulls, cognitive shifts, and action triggers that complete exchanges. Then reconstruct every touchpoint to trigger transactions, not just admiration. Deep resonance plus clear value equals actual revenue.",
    "triptychDescription": "Premier Foods expanding into new categories while their core brands underperform. Classic symptom of misalignment nobody can name. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where these lenses don't align. Like when marketing promises what product can't deliver while strategy assumes capabilities that don't exist. See all three, or see nothing.\n"
