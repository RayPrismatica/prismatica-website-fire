    "newsInsight": "UK just announced 7,000 NHS staff cuts while approving £1bn in severance. Everyone's screaming about healthcare collapse. Wrong variable. When you pay people a billion to leave during a staffing crisis, you're not cutting costs. You're buying flexibility for something bigger.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The NHS cuts, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: what massive systemic change requires clearing 7,000 positions so urgently they'll pay a billion to do it fast?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's healthcare practice helps systems optimize staffing models through predictive analytics. Brilliant work, saves millions annually. But imagine if that level of strategic workforce planning wasn't just for health ministries with eight figure budgets?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed the NHS paying £1bn to cut 7,000 jobs, and the What We Do page wondered what systemic change justified that urgency?\n"
