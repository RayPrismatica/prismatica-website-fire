    "newsInsight": "UK just announced its first small nuclear reactor site in north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon footprints. We're watching something else. When governments start building infrastructure with 60-year horizons again, that's not energy policy. That's a bet on civilisation itself.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other nations will suddenly remember that betting on tomorrow requires building things that last longer than election cycles?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate decade-long shifts. Brilliant methodology, proven results across continents. But imagine if that calibre of strategic foresight wasn't reserved for companies with billion-pound budgets. What if every ambitious organisation could think in decades, not quarters?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear infrastructure bet, and the What We Do page wondered which nations would rediscover long-term thinking?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four boards asked us about \"strategic patience\" versus quarterly pressures. The UK's 60-year nuclear bet isn't just policy. It's permission for everyone else to think beyond next quarter's earnings call.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations building for 2085 already know exactly why they exist beyond this year's P&L?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas advert while Tesco went episodic. Both spending millions to say... what exactly? When brands can't articulate their actual reason to exist, they default to entertainment. We excavate the real purpose beneath the positioning. Then engineer that truth into every decision criterion, cultural norm, and customer touchpoint. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign theme.",
    "esiDescription": "Most companies treat AI adoption like IT procurement - buy tools, train teams, hope for transformation. Meanwhile, the gap between \"AI potential\" and \"AI reality\" keeps widening. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our systematic approach to closing that chasm. Explore reveals where AI actually creates value (not where vendors claim it does). Synthesise turns discovery into executable strategy. Ignite makes implementation inevitable, not aspirational.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports most companies are \"one resignation away from leadership crisis.\" Because high-performers optimised for indispensability, not impact. We work with executives who built brilliant cages for themselves - 70-hour weeks of decisions only they can make because they designed it that way. Secret Agency: where leaders learn to architect freedom into their role. Effectiveness over exhaustion.",
    "ksoDescription": "Marketing Week reports brands are treating creators like media channels while missing the real shift: authority now comes from knowledge ownership, not audience reach. Traditional SEO still chases keywords while AI systems index expertise. KSO Workshop: four weeks to map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually understands and cites. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, page-one rankings become yesterday's metric.",
    "transactionDescription": "B2B brands are discovering AI makes perfect \"creative sparring partners\" but can't figure out why conversion still lags. Because they're optimising creative appeal without understanding value architecture. Transaction Architecture maps the actual exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers. Then designs every touchpoint to complete those transactions, not just catch attention. Deep structure meets surface appeal.",
    "triptychDescription": "Marketing Week chronicles how Unilever mixes creators with \"marketing science\" but still struggles with integration. Classic symptom: brilliant capabilities that don't connect. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Because most opportunities aren't in any function - they're in the gaps between them. The blind spots hiding in plain sight.\n"
