    "newsInsight": "NYT reports Trump knew about Epstein's conduct according to new emails. Everyone's diving into the scandal angles. We see something else. When powerful networks protect each other this long, it reveals how trust actually works at the top. Not morality. Just mutually assured destruction.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "Those Epstein emails about Trump, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if everyone knew and no one spoke, what does that tell us about how boards really evaluate CEO risk?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest research maps CEO succession patterns across 500 global firms. Incredible data, unmatched rigor. But what if that level of pattern recognition could be applied in real time, not just retrospectively? What if every leadership decision could tap that intelligence?\n"
