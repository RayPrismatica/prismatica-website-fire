    "newsInsight": "UK just released data showing hospitals kept using heart devices that killed more patients. Everyone's debating medical ethics. We see something else. When systems optimise for avoiding litigation over saving lives, you get exactly what you measure for.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The hospital heart device scandal, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other industries are optimising for legal safety over actual safety right now?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks achieve 70% success rates through rigorous stage-gating and risk assessment. Decades of refinement, battle-tested across continents. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't reserved for eight-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed hospitals using deadly devices to avoid lawsuits, and the What We Do page wondered which industries optimise for legal over actual safety?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three boards asked us about risk frameworks while their actual risks sat in plain sight, documented but ignored.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations defending the indefensible always forgot why they exist beyond compliance?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco went episodic storytelling. Both spending millions to say nothing. Most brands confuse having a message with having a reason to exist. We excavate your actual purpose, not the poster version, then engineer it into every decision criterion and customer touchpoint. Purpose as operating system: when everyone knows why you exist, they stop making decisions that contradict it.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC is rebranding as a startup while missing the obvious: new names don't fix old thinking. Every rebrand follows the same pattern - brilliant discovery phase, compelling strategy deck, then execution that looks exactly like before. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that canyon. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise transforms insights into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop.",
    "agencyDescription": "Warren Buffett just shared his three success lessons and everyone's taking notes like it's scripture. Meanwhile he works four hours a day. We see founders grinding 80-hour weeks studying productivity while Buffett reads annual reports in his pyjamas. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the difference between looking successful and being effective. Because optimising your calendar isn't the same as optimising your impact.",
    "ksoDescription": "Microsoft and Anthropic just announced AI data centres while most brands still optimise for keywords Google stopped caring about. ChatGPT doesn't read meta tags. Perplexity cites knowledge, not backlinks. KSO Workshop: four weeks to transform your content from searchable to citable. We map your intellectual territory into knowledge graphs AI actually understands. Because when AI answers questions, your Google rankings become archaeological artifacts.",
    "transactionDescription": "Prime Video reaches 315 million viewers who still won't pay for ad-free. They built massive reach but forgot the value exchange. Transaction Architecture maps why people actually transact across three dimensions: emotional resonance, cognitive understanding, and behavioural triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Reach without transaction architecture is just expensive exposure.",
    "triptychDescription": "Unilever discovered creators deliver better ROI than traditional marketing but can't explain why. Marketing sees engagement, product sees irrelevance, no one connects the dots. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do your biggest opportunities. The diagnosis that makes everyone say \"how did we miss that?\"\n"
