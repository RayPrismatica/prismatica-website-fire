    "newsInsight": "Trump Organisation just announced a Saudi real estate deal whilst their ethics watchdogs are still writing last term's report. Everyone sees conflict. We see pattern recognition at scale. What private equity learns through a thousand deals, politics teaches you by Tuesday morning.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Trump Saudi deal, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: when did \"conflict of interest\" become just another asset class, and what does that tell us about risk pricing in 2025?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's new transformation framework helps Fortune 500s navigate stakeholder complexity. Decades of refinement, world-class rigour. But what if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access thinking that sharp?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Trump's Saudi deal pattern, and the What We Do page wondered when conflicts became asset classes?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about \"reputational arbitrage\" without using those words. That's not random enquiries. That's the market discovering ethics and economics aren't opposites anymore.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations navigating controversy best already filter every decision through 'why we exist beyond returns'?",
    "serviceDescription": "Burberry just reported first growth in two years by remembering what made them Burberry. Meanwhile half the luxury sector chases trends they don't even believe in. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then engineer that truth into every decision filter and customer touchpoint. Not brand therapy. Brand architecture. Purpose as infrastructure, not Instagram caption.",
    "esiDescription": "Premier Foods expanded into new categories because they finally connected consumer insights to operational capabilities. Most companies have brilliant insights gathering dust. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that gap. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise makes it actionable, Ignite ensures execution. Research and strategy and implementation as one continuous loop, not three separate consultancies hoping someone connects the dots.",
    "agencyDescription": "The Atlantic explores how ground-shifting chaos paralyses even great leaders. Familiar? We work with executives who realise their 80-hour weeks contain maybe 20 hours of actual leadership. Secret Agency: where high-performers unlearn the patterns that got them here but won't get them there. Strategic clarity over inbox management. Because effectiveness and exhaustion stopped being synonymous years ago.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports Yeti just hired their first ad agency ever. Why? Because being findable on Google means nothing when AI answers don't mention you. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually comprehends and cites. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Traditional SEO optimises for yesterday's game.",
    "transactionDescription": "Diageo credits \"brand desirability\" for growth but can't explain why desire translates to purchase for them, not competitors. Most businesses confuse wanting with buying. Transaction Architecture maps the actual value exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep structure meets surface appeal.",
    "triptychDescription": "John Lewis's Christmas ad testing well whilst their retail struggles continue. Strong creative, weak commercial reality. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where those perspectives don't align. Like finding the bug in code by running three debuggers at once.\n"
