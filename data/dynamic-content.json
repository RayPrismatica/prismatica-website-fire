    "newsInsight": "UK growth just slowed after car production crashed. Everyone sees recession signals. We see something else. When one sector tanks and drags down GDP, that's not economic weakness. That's concentration risk wearing a recovery costume.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK car production collapse, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other single-industry dependencies are hiding in plain sight across major economies right now?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's new transformation playbooks help Fortune 500s navigate volatility with unprecedented analytical rigour. Decades of pattern recognition, world-class frameworks. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's growth slowdown from car production, and the What We Do page wondered which other single-industry dependencies are hiding?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about concentration risk they never thought to measure. That's the market discovering its blind spots in real time.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the UK's entire growth story collapsed when one industry sneezed? The companies weathering volatility best already knew their answer to 'why do we exist beyond making money?'",
    "serviceDescription": "OpenAI just announced GPT-5.1 with \"fewer hallucinations\" while their entire business model hallucinates its own sustainability. Watch every AI-dependent company realise they've built on sand. We dissect your actual reason to exist, then engineer that purpose into every strategic choice, partnership criterion, and customer promise. Inside-out authenticity that survives when hype cycles collapse. Purpose as navigation system, not navigation suggestion.",
    "esiDescription": "Vitality smashed sales targets with fresh life insurance positioning while the entire industry clings to fear-based messaging. Everyone sees the opportunity, no one has a system to capture it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for turning market insight into market share. Explore surfaces the strategic truth, Synthesise transforms findings into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Discovery to dominance, not discovery to PowerPoint.",
    "agencyDescription": "Warren Buffett says avoiding regret requires understanding opportunity cost. Meanwhile executives everywhere confuse motion with progress. We work with leaders drowning in 150 weekly decisions who can't remember their last strategic thought. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the brutal maths of executive attention. Because your calendar is lying about what actually moves the needle.",
    "ksoDescription": "OpenAI releases GPT-5.1 this month while most brands still optimise for Google's yesterday. Traditional SEO perfects visibility in a vanishing paradigm. KSO Workshop: we architect your knowledge graph so AI systems cite you as the authority, not just another source. Four weeks to transform from searchable to essential. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, page one rankings become trivia.",
    "transactionDescription": "Premier Foods expands into new categories after realising brand trust transfers but purchase logic doesn't. They optimised every touchpoint but missed why people actually buy. Transaction Architecture: we decode the invisible value exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive clarity, and behavioural triggers. Then engineer every interaction to complete those transactions naturally. Because great products with misaligned value architecture just create confused prospects.",
    "triptychDescription": "Cleveland Guardians made MLB history while their business operations lagged two decades behind. Brilliant on-field strategy, dated everywhere else. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously because excellence in isolation still equals system failure. The gaps between functions hide both your biggest risks and untapped opportunities. Most leadership teams can't see them from inside.\n"
