    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon footprints. Meanwhile China's building 150 of these while we held planning meetings. Sometimes the greenest energy policy is just building something.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if small reactors take 10 years from approval to power, what exactly is Britain's plan for the next decade?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation practice helps Fortune 500s navigate energy transitions with frameworks refined over decades. Brilliant rigour, world-class thinking. But what if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious organisation could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear approval taking years while China builds 150 reactors, and the What We Do page wondered about Britain's energy plan for the next decade?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about energy resilience while their competitors quietly locked in 20-year power contracts. The smart money moved six months ago.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how countries approving reactors can articulate their 50-year vision while those debating can't explain next winter?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just announced they're changing their name and \"embracing the ethos of a startup\" after years of ratings decline. Watch legacy brands everywhere realise their problem isn't the logo. We excavate why your business actually exists beyond quarterly earnings, then engineer that purpose into every decision, system, and customer touchpoint. Not rebrand theatre - actual DNA change. Purpose as operating system, not press release.",
    "esiDescription": "Fossil electricity stopped growing globally last year, but nobody noticed because the insight lived in spreadsheets, not boardrooms. Classic exploration without execution. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for making discovery actionable. Explore finds the truth, Synthesise turns data into decisions, Ignite makes strategy move. Because knowing fossil power peaked means nothing if you don't reposition today.",
    "agencyDescription": "SoftBank just sold its entire Nvidia stake to bet on OpenAI, admitting they left $60 billion on the table by selling too early. Even the smartest money makes reactive decisions when overwhelmed. We work with leaders drowning in opportunities who've forgotten the difference between urgent and important. Secret Agency: where executives relearn to think in decades while everyone else reacts to quarters. Because decision quality beats decision velocity.",
    "ksoDescription": "Paul Skenes just won NL Cy Young, but AI search engines don't know who he is because sports sites optimised for Google, not knowledge graphs. Traditional SEO assumes people search - KSO assumes AI answers. Four-week intensive to transform your content from searchable to citable. We map your expertise into structures LLMs actually understand and reference. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, being first on Google means nothing.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose launched a star-studded rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco went with \"perfectly imperfect\" family moments. One triggers nostalgia, the other triggers purchases. Transaction Architecture: we decode the invisible value exchange beneath visible creative. Map how decisions actually happen across emotional pull, rational permission, and action triggers. Then architect every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Because great creative without conversion architecture is just expensive entertainment.",
    "triptychDescription": "Cheez-It wants to become the UK's \"next iconic brand\" while Unilever mixes creators with \"marketing science.\" Both solving for awareness when the real gap is between brand promise and product experience. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and deliver simultaneously. Problems hide where those three don't align. Like Cheez-It pushing brand campaigns while UK consumers can't actually find the product in stores.\n"
