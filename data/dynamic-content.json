    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small nuclear reactor for north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon footprints. We're watching something else. When governments start building nuclear near population centres, that's not climate policy. That's energy independence going local.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which nations realise distributed energy beats centralised grids before the next crisis forces the lesson?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest energy transition framework helps utilities navigate the shift to renewables. Decades of sector expertise, unmatched analytical rigour. But what if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious energy startup could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear pivot to local energy, and the What We Do page wondered which nations would learn before crisis forces them?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about energy resilience strategies. Not sustainability. Resilience. The smart money sees what's coming before the headlines spell it out.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations thriving through energy shocks already answered 'why we exist' without mentioning quarterly earnings?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just announced they're rebranding as a startup after decades as legacy media. Watch every institution realise their 'heritage' is actually handcuffs. We excavate your actual reason to exist beneath the accumulated corporate sediment. Then architect that purpose into every hiring filter, product decision, and customer promise. Not another mission statement. An operating system that makes strategy obvious and culture automatic.",
    "esiDescription": "Anthropic taught their AI to control robot dogs this week. Everyone got the demo. Nobody got the system. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: the framework that turns 'cool tech' into 'market dominance'. Explore finds the real opportunity hiding behind the hype. Synthesise transforms discovery into executable strategy. Ignite makes ideas move through organisations. Because breakthrough insight without breakthrough execution is just expensive theatre.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports SoftBank dumped their entire Nvidia stake to bet everything on OpenAI. Classic high-performer trap: confusing motion with progress. We work with executives who realise their 70-hour weeks are 20 hours of strategy and 50 hours of anxiety management. Secret Agency: where leaders learn the difference between being busy and being effective. Because at your level, time isn't the constraint. Clarity is.",
    "ksoDescription": "Anthropic and Microsoft just announced massive AI data centres across three states. Traditional SEO optimises for a world that's already gone. KSO Workshop: we map your expertise into knowledge structures AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when AI answers business questions, page one of Google becomes page zero of relevance.",
    "transactionDescription": "Unilever reveals they trust creators more than their own brand messaging. They're measuring engagement but missing the transaction. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people actually buy across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those value exchanges. Because viral reach without transactional depth just feeds your competitors' funnels.",
    "triptychDescription": "Prime Video hit 315 million monthly viewers yet Waitrose beats them for cultural relevance with one Christmas ad. Massive reach, minimal impact. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously to find what's hiding between the silos. The best opportunities live in those gaps. So do the worst vulnerabilities.\n"
