    "newsInsight": "Anthropic's Claude just taught a robot dog new tricks and everyone's debating AI consciousness. Wrong conversation. The real question is which companies have business models that survive when AI learns faster than their product cycles.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "Anthropic's robot dog, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if AI can learn physical skills overnight, what happens to every business built on human expertise having a learning curve?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's digital transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate AI disruption. Decades of pattern recognition, world-class rigour. But imagine if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure engagements. What if every ambitious team could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Anthropic's AI learning physical skills, and the What We Do page wondered about businesses built on expertise barriers?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, five CEOs asked us about AI replacing their core competency. That's not paranoia. That's pattern recognition before the headlines catch up.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how companies scrambling to \"add AI features\" can't explain why they exist without mentioning their old moat?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just rebranded as a startup while traditional media collapses around them. Cute rebrand, wrong diagnosis. They're optimising messaging while their purpose evaporated. We excavate why your organisation actually exists, then architect that truth through every decision and customer touchpoint. Inside-out clarity that makes pivots feel inevitable, not desperate. Purpose as navigation system, not nostalgia.",
    "esiDescription": "Cheez-It wants to become the UK's \"next iconic brand\" but their strategy deck probably gathers dust between quarterly reviews. Classic insight-to-execution canyon. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for making discovery actionable. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms findings into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually moves. Not three consulting phases. One continuous engine.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports executives are turning to climate anxiety counselling because they can't separate signal from noise anymore. Peak high-performer trap. We work with leaders drowning in \"urgent\" who forgot what important looks like. Secret Agency: where executives relearn the difference between motion and progress. Because optimising for inbox zero when your industry's being disrupted is performance theatre, not performance.",
    "ksoDescription": "Microsoft and Anthropic are building AI data centres while most brands still chase backlinks. Traditional SEO optimises for yesterday's game. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI systems actually cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, page one of Google becomes irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Prime Video hit 315 million viewers but Waitrose's rom-com Christmas ad will probably convert better. Reach without resonance is just expensive noise. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people actually buy across emotional triggers, comprehension shifts, and action catalysts. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep psychological alignment wrapped in surface appeal. Because understanding beats manipulation every time.",
    "triptychDescription": "SoftBank sold its entire Nvidia stake to bet on OpenAI. Brilliant AI strategy, but did anyone check if their portfolio companies can survive the shift? Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do ten-billion-dollar oversights.\n"
