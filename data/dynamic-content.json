    "newsInsight": "UK just announced police commissioners will be scrapped across England and Wales. Everyone's debating democracy. We're watching something else. When organisations eliminate entire oversight layers overnight, that's not reform. That's admission the original design never worked.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The scrapped police commissioners, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which expensive corporate oversight functions exist purely because nobody wants to admit the underlying system is broken?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation playbooks help Fortune 500s navigate massive organisational redesigns. Decades of pattern recognition distilled into frameworks that actually work. But what if that calibre of systems thinking wasn't limited to seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK scrapping police commissioners, and the What We Do page wondered which corporate oversight layers only exist to mask broken systems?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about \"governance restructuring\" which is code for \"we built expensive oversight for problems we should have fixed at the root.\"",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations panicking most about accountability can't explain why certain roles exist beyond \"governance best practice\"?",
    "serviceDescription": "Premier Foods just announced expansion into new categories while their competitors retreat. The difference? They know exactly why they exist beyond \"selling food products.\" We excavate your actual reason for being, not the mission statement collecting dust. Then engineer that purpose into every hiring decision, product launch, and customer interaction. Most companies discover their stated values and actual decisions live in parallel universes. Purpose as operating system means both universes merge.",
    "esiDescription": "Vitality smashed sales targets by rethinking life insurance but almost abandoned the strategy twice because insights lived in marketing while execution sat in product. Classic. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our architecture for closing that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually moves. Not three separate engagements. One continuous system where research feeds strategy feeds execution feeds research.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports AI adoption fails most at C-suite level because executives delegate what they don't understand. Sound familiar? We work with leaders drowning in \"strategic initiatives\" they assigned to others because they're too busy managing up to actually think down. Secret Agency: where executives relearn the difference between motion and progress. Because when you're in back-to-back meetings about meetings, you're optimising for calendar density, not decision quality.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company notes flight reductions stay at 6% while business travel AI search queries explode on ChatGPT, not Google. Your SEO team still optimising for a game that's ending. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually understands and cites. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when Perplexity answers your market's questions, page-one Google rankings become yesterday's vanity metric.",
    "transactionDescription": "Premier Foods' new category success isn't about brand extension. It's about understanding which emotional job their products actually do. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people really buy across three dimensions - emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions, not just inspire them. Most brands nail appeal but fumble the actual value exchange. Deep truth without surface appeal is invisible. Surface appeal without deep truth is empty.",
    "triptychDescription": "Marketing Week profiles B2B brands using AI for creative while their sales teams still cold-call from spreadsheets. Textbook silo dysfunction. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously because problems hide where functions don't talk. That innovative product feature your competitors copied? Your marketing team never mentioned it. That customer pain point everyone knows? Product roadmap doesn't address it. Opportunities live in gaps. So do failures.\n"
