    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon targets. We're watching something else. When nuclear goes from national projects to local installations, that's not just energy policy. That's decentralisation at infrastructure scale.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other \"too big for anyone but government\" sectors are about to discover they're actually small enough for startups?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest transformation framework helps Fortune 500s navigate complexity with military precision. Brilliant methodology, decades of refinement. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear going local, and the What We Do page wondered which other big sectors might fragment next?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three different boards asked us about \"infrastructure as a service\" models. The UK nuclear news isn't about energy. It's about scale assumptions collapsing everywhere.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the companies weathering market shifts already know why they exist beyond quarterly earnings?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just dropped a rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco went episodic storytelling. Both brilliant executions missing the same thing: why does your brand exist if Amazon delivers groceries cheaper? We excavate your actual reason to exist, then engineer it into every decision, product launch, and customer moment. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign. Because when markets shift, \"we sell things\" isn't a strategy.",
    "esiDescription": "Most companies are \"one resignation away from a leadership crisis\" says Fast Company. Translation: insight lives in heads, not systems. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our framework for making transformation repeatable. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise creates clarity, Ignite makes it move. Knowledge to strategy to execution, continuous loop. Because depending on irreplaceable people isn't leadership, it's liability.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports 86,000 people studied: learning languages literally reverses cognitive aging. Meanwhile executives we know can't remember the last book they finished. Secret Agency: where high-performers realise their 70-hour weeks are 20 hours of value and 50 hours of performance theatre. Optimise for cognitive longevity, not calendar density. Because burnout ages your brain faster than time does.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company asks if AI will follow media rules. Wrong question. AI doesn't index content, it maps knowledge. Your SEO strategy assumes people search. ChatGPT assumes they ask. KSO Workshop: four weeks to transform from keyword-stuffed to knowledge-authoritative. We architect your expertise into structures AI naturally cites. Because when machines answer questions, page rank means nothing.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week reports Unilever trusts creators more than their own brand teams. There's your symptom. Transaction Architecture maps why people actually buy across three dimensions: what moves them, what convinces them, what triggers action. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete that arc. Deep psychological architecture meets surface creative. Because great campaigns without transaction design just win awards, not customers.",
    "triptychDescription": "Forbes reports Cleveland Guardians' manager making MLB history. Individual brilliance. But notice their season: great pitching, solid batting, somehow missed playoffs. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions meet. Like strong teams that somehow produce weak results. Most companies audit departments. We audit the gaps between them.\n"
