    "newsInsight": "UK just announced its first small nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone's debating clean energy. We see something else. When governments start building infrastructure they actually need 20 years from now, that's not policy. That's panic dressed as planning.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other \"future infrastructure\" projects are actually emergency responses to dependencies we can't admit we have?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate energy transitions with methodical precision. Brilliant systems, refined over decades. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious organisation could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear panic disguised as planning, and the What We Do page wondered about hidden dependencies?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three CEOs asked us about \"energy independence\" who've never mentioned it before. That's not environmental awakening. That's boards realising their entire supply chain assumptions just became fiction.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations announcing \"sustainability initiatives\" can't explain why beyond compliance? Then cascade that purpose through every system and touchpoint.",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco went episodic. Both spending millions to say nothing. Watch brands everywhere confuse production value with actual value proposition. We excavate why your business actually exists, then engineer that truth into every decision, campaign, and customer moment. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal sentiment. Because customers can smell the difference between authentic mission and agency creative.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebranding as a startup while missing the actual transformation required. Everyone sees the need to change, nobody has a system to execute it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our framework for closing that canyon. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise converts insight to strategy, Ignite makes strategy happen. Not three separate phases. One continuous system where discovery feeds execution feeds discovery.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports most companies are one resignation from leadership crisis. Exactly. We work with CEOs who've built their entire operation around their personal bandwidth. Secret Agency: where founders learn the difference between being essential and being the bottleneck. Because that 80-hour week isn't dedication, it's poor systems design masquerading as commitment.",
    "ksoDescription": "Microsoft and Anthropic just announced AI data centres while marketers still optimise for Google keywords. Traditional SEO perfects yesterday's game. KSO Workshop: we architect your knowledge into structures AI systems actually comprehend and reference. Four weeks to shift from searchable to citable. Because when customers ask AI for recommendations, your page rank becomes irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Citizens Bank closing branches while wondering why digital adoption lags. They mapped every customer touchpoint but missed why people actually switch banks. Transaction Architecture: we decode decisions across emotional trust, rational comparison, and friction triggers. Then design each interaction to complete those value exchanges. Because optimising checkout flows means nothing if you've misunderstood why people checkout.",
    "triptychDescription": "Fast Company reports companies drowning in AI announcements from Microsoft, Anthropic, everyone. Strong tech teams, clear AI strategy, still getting lapped by competitors who started last month. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market AI capability, compete on AI advantage, and actually build AI systems—simultaneously. The disconnect usually lives between those lenses. Along with your biggest opportunity.\n"
