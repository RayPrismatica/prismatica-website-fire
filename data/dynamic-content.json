    "newsInsight": "Xi just purged his nuclear command and NYT reports unease in China's military forces. Everyone's debating Taiwan timelines. Wrong variable. When autocrats clean house this aggressively, they're not preparing for external war. They're fighting an internal one.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "Xi's nuclear purges, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if you're planning to use weapons, why fire the people who know how to use them? Unless the real threat isn't from outside.\n"
