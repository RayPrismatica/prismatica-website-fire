    "newsInsight": "Sara Sharif's murder investigation just exposed how social services, schools, and police all documented warning signs but never connected them. Classic optimisation failure. Everyone perfecting their process while a child dies in the gaps between systems.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Sara Sharif case, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: how many corporate disasters follow the same pattern of everyone documenting problems in their silo while catastrophe builds in the blind spots?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate complexity with surgical precision. Decades of pattern recognition distilled into systematic approaches. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Sara Sharif's systemic failures, and the What We Do page wondered about corporate disasters hiding in organisational blind spots?",
    "marketObservation": "This week we're watching companies announce \"transformation initiatives\" while their best people document problems no one connects. That's the pattern before every preventable crisis.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations in crisis can list their values but can't explain why those values failed to prevent disaster?",
    "serviceDescription": "Burberry just celebrated brand desirability gains after two years of decline, but Premier Foods is crushing it by knowing exactly why they exist beyond shareholder returns. Watch the pattern: companies with decorative purpose statements struggle while those with operational purpose thrive. We excavate your actual reason for existing, then engineer it into every hiring decision, product choice, and customer interaction. Purpose as decision filter, not conference room poster.",
    "esiDescription": "Disney's TV business is collapsing while they optimize streaming metrics, missing how the entire value exchange shifted. Classic insight-execution gap. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for connecting discovery to action. Explore reveals uncomfortable truths, Synthesise turns chaos into clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three consulting phases. One continuous loop.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports CEOs struggling with performance management because they're optimising for activity not outcomes. Familiar? We work with executives drowning in 70-hour weeks that produce 40 hours of value. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the difference between motion and progress. Because being busy stopped correlating with being effective somewhere around your third promotion.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports Trump administration hasn't implemented Grok on their AI platform while businesses still chase Google rankings. Meanwhile, AI search grows 40% quarterly. KSO Workshop: we map your knowledge territory so AI systems cite you as the authority. Four weeks to shift from searchable to essential. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, your SEO strategy becomes archaeology.",
    "transactionDescription": "Vitality smashed sales targets by discovering people don't buy life insurance, they buy permission to stop worrying. Every insurer sells coverage, Vitality sold psychological relief. Transaction Architecture: we map the actual value exchange across emotional, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions. Then design every touchpoint to complete that exchange. Deep psychological truth meets elegant user journey.",
    "triptychDescription": "Verizon cutting 15,000 jobs while restructuring reveals what happens when strategy, operations, and market position drift apart unnoticed. Each function optimised perfectly. The system still failed. Strategic Triptych Assessment: simultaneous examination of how you market, compete, and build. Problems hide where functions intersect. So do breakthrough opportunities. See the whole system at once."
