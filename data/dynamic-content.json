    "newsInsight": "UK just announced its first small nuclear reactor site in north Wales. Everyone sees energy security. We see the end of scale economics. When nuclear goes modular, every assumption about infrastructure investment breaks.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK's small nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if energy infrastructure can go from megaprojects to modules, what other \"too big to fail\" systems are about to become \"small enough to succeed\"?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation practice helps Fortune 500s navigate disruption with their legendary frameworks. Decades of pattern recognition, unmatched rigour. But imagine if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers. What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's modular nuclear shift, and the What We Do page wondered what other megaprojects might atomise?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about \"infrastructure as a service\" models. That's not coincidence. That's capital markets realising fixed assets are becoming variable costs.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the companies thriving in this modular world already know why they exist beyond returns?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just spent millions on a star-studded Christmas ad while their actual customers can't articulate why they shop there over Tesco. Marketing excellence masking strategic hollowness. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then architect that purpose into every decision filter, hiring screen, and customer interaction. Inside-out alignment that makes both culture and messaging ring true. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebranding itself as a startup while still operating like legacy media. Classic insight-execution canyon. Everyone knows they need to transform, no one has a system to actually do it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for bridging that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise converts chaos into clarity, Ignite makes strategy executable. Continuous loop, not consultant theatre.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Warren Buffett sharing success lessons while working exactly three hours a day on actual decisions. Meanwhile, most CEOs confuse calendar density with strategic value. Secret Agency is for executives who recognise that pattern in themselves. We strip away performative busyness to reveal what actually drives results. Because at your level, the enemy isn't competition. It's complexity you created.",
    "ksoDescription": "Forbes announces Paul Skenes wins awards while speculation swirls about his next move. Meanwhile, AI never mentions most brands winning traditional awards because they optimised for algorithms that no longer matter. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory so AI systems recognise and cite your authority. Four weeks to shift from keyword rankings to knowledge ownership. When ChatGPT answers industry questions, will it mention you?",
    "transactionDescription": "Cheez-It investing millions to become UK's \"next iconic brand\" without understanding why British consumers actually change snack habits. Surface tactics, zero depth. Transaction Architecture maps the actual value exchange across emotional triggers, cognitive shifts, and purchase catalysts. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep psychology meets surface polish. Because great products with misaligned value propositions just create expensive inventory.",
    "triptychDescription": "Prime Video reaching 315 million viewers while missing obvious monetisation plays their product and competitive teams surely see individually. That's not stupidity. That's siloed excellence. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Problems hide where functions intersect. So do your biggest opportunities. What's hiding in your blind spots?\n"
