    "newsInsight": "Henry Zeffman at the BBC just suggested Starmer's attempts to shore up his leadership may have backfired. Classic optimisation trap. When fixing perception becomes more important than fixing reality, every move makes things worse.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "Starmer's leadership crisis, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: when did managing the narrative become harder than managing the actual problem?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation playbooks help Fortune 500s navigate crisis communications. Decades of refinement, bulletproof frameworks. But what if that level of strategic clarity wasn't reserved for companies with crisis budgets? What if every leader could access it before the crisis hits?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Starmer's leadership fixes backfiring, and the What We Do page wondered when managing narratives became harder than managing reality?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four CEOs asked us about \"perception management\" while their actual operations were on fire. The pattern's clear: when leaders focus on how things look instead of how things work, both get worse.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations in crisis can't explain their decisions without mentioning \"optics\" or \"messaging\"?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just announced they're changing their name and \"embracing the ethos of a startup\" after years of declining relevance. Classic case of organisations that forgot why they exist chasing surface-level fixes. We dissect your actual reason for being, then cascade that purpose through every decision and system. When everyone knows why you exist beyond revenue, transformation isn't traumatic. Purpose as operating system, not rebrand exercise.",
    "esiDescription": "Citizens Bank is closing branches across seven states with no coherent explanation of the strategy. Everyone sees the problem, no one has a system to address it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our framework for turning insight into action. Explore surfaces the truth, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Because knowing what's broken and fixing it shouldn't require different consultants.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Warren Buffett just shared three lessons for success, and they're all about doing less, not more. Meanwhile executives everywhere are drowning in decisions they used to handle easily. Secret Agency: where high-performers realise their 80-hour weeks produce 30 hours of value. We help you optimise for impact while everyone else optimises for inbox zero.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports legacy brands are trying to \"lead the next consumer revolution\" while still playing by Google's 2010 rules. Traditional SEO makes you searchable, KSO makes you citable. Four-week intensive to map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually understands and references. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, page one rankings become yesterday's victory.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose just launched a \"star-studded cinematic Christmas ad\" hoping emotion drives conversion. Pretty films, shame they forgot why people actually choose where to shop. Transaction Architecture maps the real value exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers. Then we design every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep understanding meets surface appeal. That's when pretty actually pays.",
    "triptychDescription": "Tesco's embracing \"episodic storytelling\" for Christmas while Waitrose goes cinematic. Both missing that their real competition isn't each other's ads but Amazon's convenience. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, how you compete, and how you execute simultaneously. The biggest threats always hide between those lenses. So do the biggest opportunities.\n"
