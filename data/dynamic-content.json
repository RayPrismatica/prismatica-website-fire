    "newsInsight": "UK's first small nuclear reactor just got greenlit for north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon targets. We're watching something else. When nations start building distributed power infrastructure instead of centralised grids, that's not energy policy. That's resilience thinking going mainstream.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear reactor announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which industries are quietly building redundancy into their core operations, and what does that tell us about their 2025 risk assessments?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help CEOs navigate uncertainty with military precision. Brilliant methodology, decades of refinement, worth every penny of those seven-figure engagements. But imagine if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind corporate procurement processes. What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's pivot to small nuclear reactors, and the What We Do page wondered which industries are building redundancy into operations?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four boards asked us about \"resilience architecture\" without prompting. That's not coincidence. Smart money's quietly restructuring for distributed everything while headlines still debate centralised solutions.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations planning for 2030 can articulate exactly why they exist, while those just surviving can't see past next quarter?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just rebranded itself as a startup while legacy media burns. They're not changing their name, they're admitting their purpose expired. We excavate why your business actually exists beyond the mission statement nobody reads. Then engineer that truth into every hiring decision, product choice, and customer interaction. Purpose as daily operating system, not annual report poetry. Because organisations that know their 'why' navigate chaos while others just react to it.",
    "esiDescription": "Fast Company reports Citizens Bank closing branches while fintech eats their lunch. Classic case: brilliant analysis of digital disruption, zero execution plan. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our systematic approach to closing that knowing-doing gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms insight into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Because the best strategy deck means nothing if it lives in PowerPoint purgatory.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports SoftBank dumped its entire Nvidia stake to bet on OpenAI. Even billionaires chasing shiny objects instead of compound returns. We work with executives who've optimised everything except their own decision patterns. You're making 200 decisions daily but only 20 matter. Secret Agency: where leaders learn to distinguish signal from noise before burnout makes the choice for them. Because effectiveness died somewhere between your third coffee and fifteenth Slack notification.",
    "ksoDescription": "Microsoft and Anthropic just announced AI data centres across three states while your SEO team still optimises for keywords. Wake up. AI doesn't read meta tags, it comprehends knowledge graphs. KSO Workshop: four weeks to transform your content from searchable to citable. We map your intellectual territory so AI systems recognise you as the source, not just another result. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, page one of Google becomes irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Unilever admits creators drive more trust than their own brands. They spent decades building brand equity just to discover people buy from people, not logos. Transaction Architecture maps the actual value exchange: what emotional shift enables purchase, what understanding unlocks commitment, what tangible proof seals the deal. Then we engineer every touchpoint to complete that transaction. Because great products with misaligned value architecture just create confused prospects.",
    "triptychDescription": "Prime Video hits 315 million viewers while Netflix panics about passwords. Both have content, tech, and marketing muscle. Difference? Amazon sees entertainment as ecosystem while Netflix sees it as product. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Problems hide where these perspectives don't align. Like discovering your competitive advantage expired while product roadmap looked the other way.\n"
