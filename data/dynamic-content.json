    "newsInsight": "OpenAI just hit 300 million weekly users and everyone's debating AI regulation. Meanwhile, the real story? A private company now shapes how a billion people think, write, and make decisions. That's not tech adoption. That's cognitive infrastructure.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The OpenAI user milestone, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: when 300 million people delegate thinking to one company, who's actually learning faster... the AI or the humans training it with every prompt?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest research shows 70% of transformations fail despite impeccable strategy. Decades of pattern recognition, world class frameworks. But what if that wisdom lived in real time systems, not PowerPoints? What if strategy evolved as fast as markets do?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed OpenAI's user explosion, and the What We Do page wondered who's actually learning faster in that exchange?\n"
