    "newsInsight": "UK just announced its first small nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone's debating carbon footprints. We're watching China build 150 similar plants while the West debates one. Sometimes the real race happens while you're still reading the rules.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: who wins when innovation requires 20-year commitments but markets reward quarterly thinking?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate decade-long pivots. Absolutely world-class strategic thinking, refined over thousands of engagements. But imagine if that calibre of insight wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers. What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear announcement while others debate, and the What We Do page wondered about long-term bets in short-term markets?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about making 20-year bets in 90-day cycles. That's not random. That's every strategic leader realising the timeline mismatch is the strategy problem.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the companies committing to nuclear-scale timelines already answered 'why we exist' without mentioning this quarter's earnings?",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just rebranded as a startup while most media companies cling to legacy models like life rafts. Watch organisations everywhere realise their purpose presentations are just expensive wallpaper. We excavate why your business actually exists beyond the investor deck, then engineer that truth into every decision filter, hiring screen, and customer promise. Purpose as operating code, not corporate poetry. Because markets reward alignment, not announcements.",
    "esiDescription": "Citizens Bank closing branches while everyone debates digital transformation perfectly captures the insight-execution canyon. Every bank knows branches are dying, few have systems to act on it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our architecture for closing that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise converts insights into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three consulting phases. One continuous system.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports most companies are one resignation from leadership crisis. Sounds about right. We work with CEOs who've optimised everything except their own cognitive load. Still making every decision because delegation feels like losing control. Secret Agency: where executives learn the difference between being essential and being the bottleneck. Because running everything means running yourself into the ground.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports work jargon invading romantic relationships while most brands still write for Google's 2015 algorithm. Your SEO team's targeting keywords while ChatGPT cites your competitor as the category expert. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually recognises and references. Four weeks to shift from searchable to citable. Because when AI answers questions, page rank means nothing.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose launches cinematic Christmas ads while conversion rates flatline across retail. They've optimised for attention but missed the actual value exchange. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people really buy across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions, not just catch eyes. Deep behavioural truth meets surface appeal. Because views without value exchanges are just expensive entertainment.",
    "triptychDescription": "Marketing Week reports brands trusting creators over themselves, but nobody asks why internal teams lost credibility. Classic symptom of system failure hiding in plain sight. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems rarely live in single functions. They hide where responsibilities overlap. See what's been invisible. Fix what's been unfixable.\n"
