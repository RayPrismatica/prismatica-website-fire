    "newsInsight": "NYT reports Trump's pick for Treasury used the exact tax dodge the IRS tried to kill. Beautiful. While everyone debates policy positions, Bessent's already showing us the real game. Tax code isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed for those who read the manual.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Bessent tax dodge story, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: If your Treasury Secretary uses loopholes the IRS hates, does that make him perfectly qualified or completely disqualified?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey helps CEOs navigate regulatory complexity with their legendary analytical frameworks. Decades of excellence, unmatched rigor. But what if that level of strategic insight wasn't just for the Fortune 100? What if every ambitious founder could tap into that thinking?",
