    "newsInsight": "UK just announced its first small modular nuclear reactor in north Wales. Everyone sees energy independence. We see something else. When nations start building reactors the size of warehouses instead of power plants, that's not just tech evolution. That's decentralised infrastructure becoming inevitable.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if small reactors can fit in industrial parks, which industries will build their own power supplies first, and what happens to grid economics when your biggest customers become self sufficient?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest energy transition framework helps governments navigate the shift to renewables. Brilliant analysis, decades of sector expertise, unmatched rigour. But what if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't reserved for nation state budgets? What if every ambitious business could access that level of thinking?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's small nuclear reactors, and the What We Do page wondered which industries would build their own power first?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about energy independence strategies. Not sustainability. Independence. The smart money sees infrastructure shifting from centralised to distributed faster than regulators can adapt.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how companies planning their own power generation already know exactly why they exist beyond quarterly earnings?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom com Christmas campaign whilst Tesco goes episodic. Both brilliant creative, both missing the point. Consumers don't buy from brands anymore, they buy from purposes. We excavate why your business actually exists, then engineer that truth into every decision criterion and customer touchpoint. Inside out authenticity that makes creative tactics obvious. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign theme.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebranding itself as a startup while missing the actual transformation required. Everyone recognises the need to change, few have systems to execute it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our framework for closing the insight to action gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous system.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Warren Buffett sharing his three lessons for success, meanwhile executives everywhere optimise for looking successful instead. We work with leaders drowning in performance theatre who've forgotten what actual performance feels like. Secret Agency: where accomplished people rediscover the difference between motion and progress. Because your 70 hour weeks producing 30 hours of value isn't dedication. It's dysfunction.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports Microsoft and Anthropic building AI data centres in Texas, New York, Georgia. Infrastructure for the search revolution already being poured in concrete. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to citable. Because when AI answers questions, your Google rankings become archaeological artefacts.",
    "transactionDescription": "Cheez It wants to become the UK's next iconic brand but can't crack British snacking psychology. Classic case of optimising appeal without understanding the actual value exchange. Transaction Architecture maps how purchase decisions really happen across emotional resonance, rational understanding, and behavioural triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep truth meeting surface appeal. Otherwise you're just another American brand wondering why Brits won't bite.",
    "triptychDescription": "Citizens Bank closing branches across seven states whilst their digital strategy assumes branch customers will happily go online. Classic blind spot between market reality and execution assumptions. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Because most failures hide where strategy meets operations meets customer reality. Problems live in those gaps. So do the opportunities.\n"
