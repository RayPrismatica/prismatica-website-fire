    "newsInsight": "UK government just announced two-thirds of military women face sexualised behaviour. Everyone's debating HR policies. We're watching something else entirely. When your best talent operates at 60% capacity because they're navigating landmines, that's not a culture problem. That's a competitive disadvantage measured in billions.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK military report, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which FTSE 100 company is about to discover their \"performance issues\" are actually just brilliant women operating with one hand tied behind their backs?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's diversity research shows 35% better returns for inclusive companies. Decades of data, irrefutable ROI calculations. But what if that insight wasn't trapped in $2M transformation programmes? What if every leadership team could access that strategic advantage without the PowerPoint theatre?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK military women facing workplace barriers, and the What We Do page wondered which companies are unknowingly handicapping their own talent?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about \"productivity puzzles\" that turned out to be culture blindness. The pattern's everywhere once you start looking.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations with the worst retention can't explain why their best people leave without mentioning compensation?",
    "serviceDescription": "Burberry just returned to growth after two years by reconnecting with its actual reason to exist. Meanwhile, most luxury brands still think purpose means sustainability reports. We excavate why your business actually matters beyond quarterly earnings, then engineer that truth into every hiring decision, product choice, and customer interaction. Because when Disney's TV business collapses while their parks thrive, it's not about channels. It's about knowing which experiences serve your actual purpose. Purpose as navigation system, not navigation suggestion.",
    "esiDescription": "Verizon announces 15,000 layoffs while their new CEO can't articulate the strategy. Classic insight-execution canyon. Everyone knows they need to transform, nobody has a system for how. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our infrastructure for bridging that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise converts chaos into clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that turns discovery into momentum.",
    "agencyDescription": "Scott Galloway's warning about treating AI like a friend hit home for the founders we work with. They're already treating their inbox like a friend, their calendar like a boss. High-performers drowning in their own efficiency. Secret Agency strips away the performance theatre to reveal what actually drives results. Because that 4am email habit isn't dedication. It's displacement activity for the strategic thinking you no longer have time for.",
    "ksoDescription": "Adobe's reinventing design with AI while most brands still optimise for keywords Google no longer prioritises. SEO teams perfecting yesterday's game. KSO Workshop rewires your content for how AI actually discovers and cites knowledge. Four weeks to transform from searchable to citable. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, being findable matters less than being foundational.",
    "transactionDescription": "Vitality smashed sales targets with a fresh take on life insurance by understanding the actual transaction isn't about death, it's about control. Most brands map customer journeys without grasping the value exchange underneath. Transaction Architecture reveals the emotional, cognitive and tangible triggers that actually cause conversion. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those exchanges. Deep resonance meeting surface appeal. Because great products with shallow understanding don't sell, they just win design awards.",
    "triptychDescription": "Premier Foods expanded into new categories successfully while bigger competitors stumbled. Why? They examined brand strength, competitive gaps, and operational capacity simultaneously instead of sequentially. Strategic Triptych Assessment applies that same multi-lens diagnosis to reveal what's hiding between your silos. Most problems aren't in marketing, product, or strategy. They're in the gaps where nobody's looking. Most opportunities too.\n"
