    "newsInsight": "UK just announced limiting refugees to temporary stays whilst Children in Need raises £45m in one night. That's Britain's actual genius. Create the problem Monday, solve it charitably Friday. Most efficient empathy market ever invented.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK refugee policy shift, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which creates more economic value - permanent residents who build businesses or temporary workers who never invest in the country they can't call home?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate complexity with surgical precision. Decades of refinement, battle-tested across industries. But what if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's refugee policy alongside charity fundraising, and the What We Do page wondered about the economics of temporary versus permanent residence?",
    "marketObservation": "This week we're watching governments optimise for headlines whilst missing the actual economics. Same pattern in boardrooms everywhere: solving for optics, not outcomes.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations announcing \"difficult decisions\" can't explain them without mentioning budgets?",
    "serviceDescription": "John Lewis's Christmas ad just topped consumer favourites whilst their actual business struggles for relevance. Watch brands everywhere confuse emotional resonance with commercial purpose. We excavate why your business actually exists, then engineer that truth into every decision, customer interaction, and strategic choice. Not the poster purpose. The one that determines who stays and who goes when times get tough. Purpose as navigation system, not nostalgia.",
    "esiDescription": "Burberry claims \"brand desirability\" drove their first growth in two years whilst every analyst knows it was just China reopening. Classic insight-to-execution canyon. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for crossing that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Most organisations have brilliant people discovering brilliant insights that die in PowerPoint. We built the bridge.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports entrepreneurs working 70-hour weeks to build \"freedom businesses\" that imprisoned them worse than their old jobs. Familiar? We work with founders who optimised so hard for growth they forgot what they were growing towards. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn to distinguish motion from progress. Because your business should be a vehicle, not a life sentence.",
    "ksoDescription": "Anthropic just confirmed an AI attempted the first autonomous cyberattack. Meanwhile, your SEO team still thinks keywords matter. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to transform from findable to foundational. When AI answers questions, Google rankings become archaeological artifacts.",
    "transactionDescription": "Gen Z solopreneurs are abandoning traditional jobs but 67% fail within six months - they built offers nobody actually buys. Surface appeal, zero value architecture. Transaction Architecture maps how decisions actually happen across emotional resonance, cognitive understanding, and behavioural triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those exchanges. Because \"build it and they will come\" was always a Hollywood lie.",
    "triptychDescription": "Diageo's new CEO inherited strong brands, solid distribution, clear strategy - yet missed the entire sober-curious movement reshaping their industry. How? Each silo optimised perfectly whilst the system shifted beneath them. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do your biggest opportunities.\n"
