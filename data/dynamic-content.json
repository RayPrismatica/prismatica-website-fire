    "newsInsight": "Mexico just erupted with thousands protesting and 120 injured in government clashes. Everyone sees political instability. We see something else. When street protests go violent in major economies, smart capital doesn't flee. It repositions. The volatility everyone fears becomes the arbitrage opportunity nobody discusses.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Mexico protests, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which multinationals are quietly expanding operations there while competitors panic about headlines?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest framework helps CEOs navigate geopolitical risk with sophisticated scenario planning. Brilliant methodology, decades of pattern recognition in emerging markets. But what if that calibre of strategic foresight wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leadership team could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Mexico's violent protests, and the What We Do page wondered which multinationals are quietly expanding while others panic?",
    "marketObservation": "This week we're watching smart money move INTO Mexico while headlines scream chaos. Pattern recognition beats panic every time.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how companies thriving through Mexico's chaos already knew their 'why' before the streets erupted?",
    "serviceDescription": "Yeti just hired their first ad agency ever after decades of organic growth. Watch what happens when a brand loses faith in its own story. We dissect why your business actually exists beyond revenue, then engineer that truth into every decision and customer touchpoint. Because when chaos hits, companies with clear purpose navigate while others just react. Inside-out authenticity that strengthens during storms, not despite them.",
    "esiDescription": "Premier Foods is expanding into new categories while competitors retreat. Everyone talks transformation, few have systems for it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for turning insight into momentum. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise converts discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that closes the knowing-doing gap.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Japan's PM held a 3AM meeting that divided the nation. Peak decision fatigue disguised as urgency. We work with leaders who've confused activity with impact, reaction with strategy. Secret Agency: where executives learn the difference between busy and effective. Because your 3AM decisions reveal whether you're leading or just responding to whoever screams loudest.",
    "ksoDescription": "Forbes asks if China's carbon plateau is permanent while everyone still optimises for Google rankings that increasingly don't matter. ChatGPT and Perplexity don't crawl websites, they index knowledge. KSO Workshop: four weeks to transform your expertise into knowledge graphs AI actually understands and cites. Own intellectual territory, not keywords. Because being findable means nothing if AI never mentions you.",
    "transactionDescription": "John Lewis Christmas ad tops early consumer polls but do they know WHY it resonates? Most brands measure sentiment without understanding the value exchange beneath. Transaction Architecture: we map how decisions actually happen across emotional triggers, cognitive shifts, and action catalysts. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Surface appeal plus deep alignment. Otherwise you're just making pretty ads that don't convert.",
    "triptychDescription": "Diageo's new CEO inherits a portfolio where brand power varies wildly by market. Strong products, smart teams, but nobody connecting the dots between market position, brand strategy, and operational reality. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. Opportunities too. See the whole board while competitors study individual pieces."
