    "newsInsight": "Scott Bessent just got exposed by NYT for using a tax dodge the IRS tried to block. Everyone's shocked a Treasury nominee played the system. Really? The smartest money managers always find the gray zones. That's literally the job description.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
