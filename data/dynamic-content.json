    "newsInsight": "UK just released unemployment data showing 5% jobless rate while job listings hit record highs. Everyone sees recession signals. We see something else entirely. When people can't find work despite companies desperate to hire, that's not economic decline. That's a matching crisis dressed up as unemployment.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK unemployment paradox, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: what happens when AI starts screening resumes for jobs AI wrote the descriptions for?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's new transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate workforce disruption. Decades of pattern recognition, world-class rigour. But what if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't reserved for seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access frameworks that actually work?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's unemployment-hiring paradox, and the What We Do page wondered if AI is creating the matching crisis?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four CEOs asked us why they can't hire despite record applicants. The pattern's obvious once you see it: their job specs describe yesterday's roles for tomorrow's problems.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how companies struggling to hire all sound identical in their job postings?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas ad while Tesco embraces episodic storytelling. Both spending millions to say nothing specific. Meanwhile their actual reason to exist gets buried under creative briefs and agency pitches. We excavate your authentic purpose from beneath the marketing sediment, then engineer it into every hiring decision, customer interaction, and strategic choice. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal campaign. Because when your teams and customers can't articulate why you matter beyond products, that's not a messaging problem. That's an existence problem.",
    "esiDescription": "Cleveland Guardians' manager just made MLB history but nobody can explain their actual strategy beyond \"scrappy underdogs.\" Classic insight-to-execution gap: everyone sees what works, nobody knows how to replicate it. Explore, Synthesize, Ignite: our systematic approach to closing that gap. Explore reveals the hidden patterns, Synthesize transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that turns \"we should\" into \"we did.\"",
    "agencyDescription": "Warren Buffett says avoiding regret requires knowing what actually matters. Easier said when you're not drowning in everyone else's priorities. We work with executives who've optimised their calendar into oblivion. Every hour scheduled, nothing important happening. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the difference between motion and progress. Because if you can't remember your last deep work session, you're not busy. You're lost.",
    "ksoDescription": "OpenAI releasing GPT-5.1 this month while most brands still optimise for Google's 2019 algorithm. Wake up. AI doesn't crawl websites, it comprehends knowledge. Your SEO strategy assumes a search paradigm that's already obsolete. KSO Workshop: four weeks to transform your content from searchable to citable. We map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI actually understands. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions without mentioning you, that's not a ranking problem. That's an existence problem.",
    "transactionDescription": "B2B brands using AI as a \"creative sparring partner\" but can't explain why deals actually close. They're optimising creative while ignoring the architecture of decision-making. Transaction Architecture maps the hidden value exchange across three dimensions: emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then we design every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Because great creative without transaction design is just expensive decoration.",
    "triptychDescription": "Unilever mixes creators with \"marketing science\" but still can't explain declining market share. Classic symptom: brilliant tactics, invisible strategy. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and build simultaneously. Most problems hide where those three intersect. Like Unilever discovering their innovation pipeline ignores what competitors already launched. The diagnosis takes days. Missing it costs years.\n"
