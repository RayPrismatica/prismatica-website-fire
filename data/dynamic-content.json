    "newsInsight": "Trump Organization just announced potential Saudi property deals while his administration prepares to reshape global trade. Everyone's debating ethics. We're watching something else. When political power and property portfolios merge, that's not corruption. That's the new model.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The Trump Saudi deals, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which Fortune 500 boards are quietly rewriting their government relations playbooks right now?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate political uncertainty. Decades of pattern recognition, world-class scenario planning. But what if that calibre of strategic foresight wasn't limited to seven-figure engagements? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed Trump's Saudi property deals, and the What We Do page wondered which boards are rewriting their playbooks?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three CEOs asked us the same question about political risk that wasn't political six months ago. That's not paranoia. That's pattern recognition.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations navigating this uncertainty best already have clarity on why they exist beyond quarterly earnings?",
    "serviceDescription": "Diageo's new CEO just arrived to find a portfolio of brilliant brands that forgot their shared reason to exist. Watch every drinks company suddenly realise \"premium spirits\" isn't actually a purpose. We excavate why your business truly exists, then architect that clarity into every decision filter, cultural norm, and customer promise. Not the mission statement on your website but the actual operating logic that makes hard choices obvious. Purpose as decision architecture, not corporate poetry.",
    "esiDescription": "John Lewis Christmas ads test brilliantly but the business keeps declining because insight and action live in different departments. Classic British retail: world-class thinking, yesterday's execution. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually ships. Not three separate engagements pretending to connect. One operating system that makes transformation systematic.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc's piece on leaders hitting plateaus nails it: successful executives confusing motion with progress. We see it weekly. Founders who built empires now drowning in the empires they built. Secret Agency serves leaders ready to admit their success patterns became prison bars. We help you distinguish performance from performance theatre. Because at your level, the enemy isn't failure. It's the success strategies that stopped working three years ago.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports the NFL literally transformed Real Madrid's stadium for one game. Meanwhile, most brands can't transform their content for the AI era. KSO Workshop: we map your expertise into knowledge structures AI systems actually cite and reference. Four weeks to evolve from keyword-stuffed to intellectually authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, being findable on Google becomes quaint.",
    "transactionDescription": "Yeti just hired their first ad agency ever. Built a billion-dollar brand on product excellence, now chasing growth through conventional marketing. Classic. Transaction Architecture maps why people actually buy across three dimensions: emotional pull, rational understanding, and action triggers. Then we engineer every touchpoint to complete those specific transactions. Because great products with mediocre value communication don't scale. They just frustrate product teams.",
    "triptychDescription": "Burberry celebrates brand desirability returning while their actual business model remains broken. Marketing wins awards, finance sees red, product wonders what they're actually making anymore. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. The dysfunction always hides between departments. So does the opportunity. One integrated diagnosis that reveals what siloed thinking conceals.\n"
