    "newsInsight": "UK just announced its first small nuclear reactor for north Wales. Everyone's debating clean energy versus safety. We're watching something else entirely. When governments start building their own power infrastructure instead of buying it, that's not energy policy. That's supply chain sovereignty making a comeback.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear reactor announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other critical infrastructure will nations suddenly decide they can't afford to outsource, and what does that mean for global supply chains built on specialisation?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's latest framework helps executives navigate supply chain resilience post-pandemic. Brilliant analysis, decades of global expertise distilled into actionable insights. But what if that level of strategic thinking wasn't reserved for seven-figure transformations? What if every ambitious leader could access that calibre of pattern recognition?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear sovereignty play, and the What We Do page wondered which other infrastructure nations would reclaim?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four countries announced plans to onshore critical infrastructure they've outsourced for decades. That's not nationalism. That's the market repricing dependency risk in real time.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how nations rediscovering sovereignty can answer 'why we exist' without mentioning GDP?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a rom-com Christmas advert while Tesco went episodic storytelling. Both spent millions perfecting the surface while missing the deeper question: what story does your existence tell? We excavate your actual reason for being, then engineer that truth into every decision, campaign, and customer moment. Not just what you say in adverts but why you deserve to exist. Purpose as infrastructure, not Instagram caption.",
    "esiDescription": "Most companies are one resignation away from a leadership crisis, Fast Company reports. Because succession planning lives in HR while strategic vision sits with the CEO and nobody built the bridge. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for making discovery actionable. Explore surfaces the hidden dependencies, Synthesise turns chaos into clarity, Ignite makes plans actually happen. Transformation as systematic process, not heroic scramble.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Warren Buffett just shared three lessons for success. Meanwhile, executives everywhere are drowning in advice while starving for clarity. We work with leaders who've read every framework but can't remember why they started. Secret Agency: where accomplished people learn to distinguish motion from progress. Because optimising everything except what matters is just sophisticated procrastination.",
    "ksoDescription": "Marketing Week reports brands trust creators more than themselves while B2B marketers use AI as a 'creative sparring partner.' They're solving for yesterday's game. KSO Workshop: we architect your knowledge into formats AI systems actually understand and reference. Four weeks to transform from keyword-searchable to intellectually authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, your Google rankings become irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week asks what brands need to know about joy in uncertain times. They're optimising for feelings while missing the fundamental exchange. Transaction Architecture: we map why people actually choose you across emotional pull, rational understanding, and behavioural triggers. Then orchestrate every touchpoint to complete that exchange. Because great vibes without value architecture just creates expensive disappointment.",
    "triptychDescription": "Unilever mixes creators with 'marketing science' but can't explain why some campaigns convert while others don't. Classic case of optimising parts while the system drifts. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do your biggest opportunities. Diagnosis across dimensions, not departments.\n"
