    "newsInsight": "UK just reported unemployment hits 5% whilst job vacancies reach record highs. Everyone sees recession signals. We see something else. When companies can't fill roles whilst people can't find work, that's not economic decline. That's the biggest matching crisis in modern labour history.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK's unemployment paradox, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: what happens when AI starts matching talent to opportunity better than humans ever could?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's new digital transformation framework helps Fortune 500s navigate disruption. Decades of brilliance, unmatched rigour. But imagine if that calibre of strategic thinking wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers. What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's employment paradox, and the What We Do page wondered what happens when AI matches talent better than humans?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four CEOs asked us about the same pattern: record vacancies alongside rising unemployment. That's the market signalling something before economists catch up.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations struggling to hire can't actually articulate what role success looks like beyond tasks?",
    "serviceDescription": "Waitrose just launched a star-studded Christmas campaign whilst their shelves sit empty from staff shortages. Watch brands everywhere realise their purpose statements mean nothing when operations can't deliver. We dissect why your business actually exists, then engineer that clarity into every hiring decision, role design, and customer promise. Inside-out authenticity that attracts the right talent and customers. Purpose as operating system, not seasonal advertising.",
    "esiDescription": "MSNBC rebrands as a startup whilst missing the actual transformation required. Everyone sees the need to change, few have systems to execute it. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for closing that gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy actually happen. Research, strategy, execution as continuous loop, not three separate PowerPoints gathering dust.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports executives increasingly anxious about climate change whilst working 70-hour weeks fighting yesterday's fires. Sound familiar? We work with leaders who optimise for inbox zero whilst their actual impact approaches zero. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the difference between motion and progress. Because responding to everything means building nothing.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reports Microsoft and Anthropic building AI data centres whilst most brands remain invisible to AI search. Traditional SEO optimises for yesterday's game. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory so AI systems cite you as the source. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, Google rankings become irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Unilever discovers creators drive more trust than brand campaigns whilst still treating influencers as media channels. They're optimising distribution but missing the value exchange. Transaction Architecture: we map why people actually buy across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and action triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those exchanges. Deep truth meets surface appeal, or you're just buying reach that doesn't convert.",
    "triptychDescription": "Prime Video reaches 315 million viewers yet struggles to convert them to buyers. Strong product, massive reach, clear strategy. Still missing revenue targets because nobody connected viewing behaviour to purchase intent. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide between departments. So do hundred-million-pound opportunities.\n"
