    "newsInsight": "UK just released unemployment data showing 5% jobless rate while job listings hit record highs. Everyone sees economic confusion. We see something else entirely. When people can't find work despite millions of openings, that's not recession. That's the skills gap eating the economy alive.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK unemployment paradox, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if there are more jobs than workers but unemployment's rising, what happens when AI makes that skills gap permanent?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate workforce disruption. Decades of refinement, world-class rigour. But imagine if that calibre of strategic insight wasn't locked behind seven-figure retainers. What if every ambitious leadership team could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's unemployment paradox, and the What We Do page wondered what happens when AI makes skills gaps permanent?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, four CEOs asked us about the same pattern: record job openings, rising unemployment, and their best people solving yesterday's problems brilliantly.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations struggling most can't explain why they exist without mentioning headcount or revenue targets?",
    "serviceDescription": "Diageo just announced stellar growth while competitors slash budgets, and everyone's asking about their marketing spend. Wrong question. Watch how companies with clear purpose weather storms while others with bigger budgets drown. We excavate your actual reason to exist, then engineer that clarity into every decision criterion and customer touchpoint. Purpose as navigation system when the market gets choppy. Because knowing why you exist matters most when everything else is uncertain.",
    "esiDescription": "Fast Company reports companies spending millions on AI transformation with zero ROI because insight and implementation live in different universes. Classic. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for making discovery actionable. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise transforms findings into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually moves. Not three separate engagements. One continuous loop that closes the knowing-doing gap.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports 2025 graduates facing the toughest job market in decades while CEOs work 80-hour weeks. Same root cause. We work with executives who've optimised themselves into exhaustion, confusing motion with progress. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn the difference between busy and effective. Because if you're too swamped to think strategically, you're not leading. You're just reacting with a fancier title.",
    "ksoDescription": "Forbes notes how AI search citations are becoming the new authority metric while most brands still chase backlinks. Traditional SEO optimises for yesterday's game. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge structures AI systems actually cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers industry questions, page one of Google becomes irrelevant.",
    "transactionDescription": "Marketing Week highlights John Lewis's Christmas ad success despite economic headwinds. Surface reading: great creative. Deeper truth: they understand the three-dimensional value exchange. Transaction Architecture maps how purchase decisions actually happen across emotional resonance, cognitive understanding, and action triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep psychological alignment disguised as delightful advertising.",
    "triptychDescription": "Burberry celebrates brand desirability returning after two years of decline. Brilliant turnaround, except they nearly died fixing symptoms in silos. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Because most lethal problems hide where functions overlap. Most breakthrough opportunities too. See the whole system or optimise yourself to death.\n"
