    "newsInsight": "UK military survey reveals two-thirds of servicewomen experienced sexualised behaviour. Everyone's shocked. We're not. Any organisation where 90% of leadership is one gender creates this. Physics, not morality.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The military harassment data, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which FTSE 100 companies have the same ratio but better lawyers?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate cultural change with surgical precision. Decades of pattern recognition distilled into playbooks worth millions. But what if that calibre of insight wasn't locked behind seven-figure minimums? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed military harassment statistics, and the What We Do page wondered which corporations have similar ratios but better NDAs?",
    "marketObservation": "This week three boards asked us about \"culture transformation\" without mentioning their 90% male leadership teams. The pattern's obvious once you see it.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how organisations with harassment scandals never had a clear answer to \"why do we exist beyond hierarchy and power?\"",
    "serviceDescription": "Burberry just returned to growth by remembering they're not actually about trenches. Watch every heritage brand realise their \"timeless values\" expired in 2019. We excavate your actual reason to exist, not the museum version, then engineer that truth into every hiring decision, product choice, and customer moment. Purpose as daily operating system. Because authenticity isn't vintage, it's voltage.",
    "esiDescription": "Disney's TV collapse shows what happens when strategic insights stay trapped in PowerPoints while operations runs last year's playbook. Everyone knew streaming would eat linear TV, nobody built a bridge. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our systematic method for closing that knowing-doing gap. Explore surfaces truth, Synthesise makes it actionable, Ignite ensures it actually happens. Not three meetings. One continuous system.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports top CEOs struggle with feedback because they've optimised for being right, not learning. Familiar? We work with executives who've won so much they forgot how to grow. Secret Agency: where accomplished leaders relearn the difference between performing leadership and actual leading. Less inbox heroics, more strategic silence. Because your 14-hour days aren't impressive, they're a systems failure.",
    "ksoDescription": "Fast Company reveals Trump's admin hasn't implemented Grok on their flagship AI app while AI search quietly eats Google's lunch. Your SEO team's still fighting yesterday's war. KSO Workshop: four weeks to map your expertise into knowledge structures AI actually understands and cites. We transform you from searchable to quotable. Because when AI answers questions, page rankings become archaeological artifacts.",
    "transactionDescription": "Vitality smashed life insurance targets by discovering people buy security, not statistics. They mapped emotional territory competitors ignored. Transaction Architecture: we decode your value exchange across three dimensions - what moves hearts, minds, and mice. Then orchestrate every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep resonance meets surface excellence. Because great products with misaligned value architecture just create confused prospects.",
    "triptychDescription": "Premier Foods expanded successfully by first understanding how brand, product, and distribution actually connect. Most companies optimise each function while missing the system. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions meet. So do breakthrough opportunities. One integrated diagnosis beats three separate consultants every time.\n"
