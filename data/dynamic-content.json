    "newsInsight": "UK just greenlit its first small nuclear reactor in Wales. Everyone's debating safety and nimbyism. We see something else. When nations start building infrastructure with 60-year horizons again, that's not energy policy. That's civilisational confidence returning.",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "The UK nuclear announcement, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: which other 'impossible' infrastructure projects suddenly become possible when governments remember they're allowed to think past the next election?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help Fortune 500s navigate decades-long shifts. Brilliant strategic architecture, worth every penny. But what if that calibre of long-term thinking wasn't reserved for companies with billion-pound budgets? What if every ambitious leader could access it?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed UK's nuclear ambitions signalling civilisational confidence, and the What We Do page wondered which other 'impossible' projects become possible?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three boards asked us about 60-year strategic planning. Not coincidence. The UK nuclear decision just gave everyone permission to think beyond quarterly earnings again.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the organisations celebrating UK's nuclear decision already know their answer to 'why we exist beyond next quarter's numbers?'",
    "serviceDescription": "MSNBC just announced it's embracing startup culture while established competitors cling to legacy thinking. Watch every media company realise their stated values are just expensive wallpaper. We excavate the actual reason your organisation exists, then engineer that purpose into every hire, decision, and customer touchpoint. Not another mission statement. An operating system that makes misalignment impossible. Purpose as infrastructure, not inspiration.",
    "esiDescription": "Citizens Bank closing branches while announcing digital transformation. Classic case of strategy and execution living on different planets. Everyone knew digital was coming, but implementation teams kept optimising yesterday's model. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our system for closing that fatal gap. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms insight into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually happens. One continuous loop, not three separate engagements gathering dust.",
    "agencyDescription": "Warren Buffett just shared his secret: he makes maybe 12 decisions a year that actually matter. Meanwhile, most executives make 12 decisions before lunch, mistaking motion for progress. We work with leaders drowning in urgent trivia while their real work waits. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn Buffett's ratio. Fewer decisions, infinitely better ones. Because your calendar is lying about what matters.",
    "ksoDescription": "Google's share just dropped while Perplexity hits 100M monthly queries. Your SEO team still optimising for an algorithm that's becoming irrelevant. KSO Workshop: we transform your expertise into knowledge graphs AI systems actually cite. Four weeks from invisible to authoritative in AI search. Because when ChatGPT answers your customer's question, page-one rankings mean nothing if AI never mentions you.",
    "transactionDescription": "Waitrose spent millions on a cinematic Christmas ad featuring rom-com stars. Beautiful work that triggers nostalgia but not necessarily transactions. They optimised for feelings without mapping the actual value exchange. Transaction Architecture: we decode why people really buy across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers. Then engineer every touchpoint to complete those transactions. Deep psychological architecture, not surface manipulation.",
    "triptychDescription": "Kennedy heir announces political run. Has the name, platform, connections. Will probably fail because nobody's examining how his market position, competitive landscape, and execution capability intersect. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we diagnose across marketing truth, competitive reality, and execution capacity simultaneously. Problems hide where these three don't align. So do massive opportunities.\n"
