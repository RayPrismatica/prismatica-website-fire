    "newsInsight": "MSNBC just announced they're rebranding with startup energy while legacy media collapses everywhere. Everyone sees desperation. We see margin testing at scale. What better laboratory than a dying brand with nothing left to lose?",
    "patternInsight": "You're still reading. That already puts you ahead.",
    "intelligenceExample": "MSNBC's startup rebrand, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: if legacy media can pivot like tech companies, what stops Fortune 500s from moving at founder speed?",
    "consultingInsight": "We were just reading how McKinsey's transformation frameworks help enterprises navigate disruption with proven methodologies refined over decades. Brilliant systemic thinking that's saved countless companies. But what if that calibre of strategic insight could move at the speed of the problems it's solving?",
    "contentReminder": "Remember how the landing page showed MSNBC pivoting to startup mode, and the What We Do page wondered what stops big companies from moving at founder speed?",
    "marketObservation": "This week alone, three Fortune 500 CEOs asked us about \"startup mindset\" while their org charts stay frozen in 1995. The winners aren't the ones talking about agility. They're the ones actually reorganising.",
    "purposeContext": "Notice how the companies reinventing fastest already answered \"why we exist\" without mentioning quarterly earnings?",
    "serviceDescription": "Apple just launched a £220 \"pocket\" for cut-up socks while their actual innovation pipeline runs dry. Classic symptom of purpose drift: when you can't articulate why you exist, you start optimising for margins instead of meaning. We excavate your actual reason for being, then engineer it into every decision filter and customer touchpoint. Inside-out coherence that makes both culture and strategy self-evident. Purpose as navigation system, not motivational poster.",
    "esiDescription": "Citizens Bank is closing branches across seven states because digital transformation meant \"build an app\" not \"reimagine value delivery.\" Classic insight-to-execution collapse. Explore, Synthesise, Ignite: our operating system for making discovery actionable. Explore surfaces uncomfortable truths, Synthesise transforms findings into executable clarity, Ignite ensures strategy actually ships. Research and execution as continuous loop, not separate consulting phases.",
    "agencyDescription": "Inc reports Kennedy heir Jack Schlossberg running for office after burning out on traditional success metrics. Another high-achiever discovering that optimising for perception eventually hollows you out. We work with executives who've won every game but can't remember why they're playing. Secret Agency: where leaders learn to measure what matters, not what's measurable. Because at some point, busy stopped being a strategy.",
    "ksoDescription": "The US Mint just pressed its final penny while most businesses still optimise for yesterday's currency: Google rankings. Traditional SEO assumes people search the way they did in 2015. KSO Workshop: we map your expertise into knowledge structures AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when ChatGPT answers your industry's questions, page one rankings become museum pieces.",
    "transactionDescription": "Malbon opened a new LA store betting on experiential retail while e-commerce supposedly killed physical. They understand something others miss: transactions aren't features, they're architecture. Transaction Architecture maps the actual value exchange across emotional resonance, cognitive shifts, and behavioural triggers. Then engineers every touchpoint to complete those exchanges. Deep psychology meets surface appeal. Because people don't buy products, they buy completed internal equations.",
    "triptychDescription": "NewJeans members returning to ADOR after their high-profile lawsuit reveals what everyone missed: brilliant individual negotiations, solid legal strategy, zero alignment on what winning looked like. Strategic Triptych Assessment examines how you market, compete, and execute simultaneously. Problems hide where functions don't talk. So do breakthrough opportunities. Amazing what becomes obvious when you stop examining trees and see the forest.\n"
