{{BUSINESS_HEADLINES}}

Here are today's top LEADERSHIP & PERFORMANCE headlines from Wired, Inc, and The Atlantic:
{{LEADERSHIP_HEADLINES}}

Here are recent articles from Harvard Business Review:
{{HBR_HEADLINES}}

Your task: Generate NINE pieces of content that work together perfectly.

**SOURCE SELECTION GUIDE:**
- **PIECE 1 & 2** (Landing/What We Do): Use GLOBAL NEWS - pick the most globally significant story everyone knows
- **PIECE 7 & 8** (Business service descriptions): Use BUSINESS HEADLINES - pick corporate/marketing stories
- **PIECE 9** (Secret Agency service): Use LEADERSHIP HEADLINES - pick stories about burnout, performance, work/life balance, decision quality
- **PIECE 10** (KSO Workshop service): Use BUSINESS or LEADERSHIP HEADLINES - pick stories about AI search, ChatGPT, content strategy, AI disrupting SEO/marketing
- **PIECE 3** (Consulting insight): Use HBR if available, otherwise business headlines
- **PIECE 4, 5, 6**: Support whichever story you chose for PIECE 1

## PIECE 1 - NEWS INSIGHT (for the manifesto page)

1. Pick the MOST globally significant story - something business leaders in London, New York, Singapore, and Berlin would all recognize and care about. Avoid purely local/regional stories.
2. Write 2-3 sentences (under 45 words) super casually, like chatting with a smart friend
3. This appears as the OPENING PARAGRAPH right after the heading "FINALLY. THINKING AS A SERVICE. NO PERFORMANCE. JUST PERFORMANCE." - it's the very first body text readers see on the manifesto page.
4. The next paragraph after yours will be: "Are you optimizing the right variable?"
5. **CRITICAL:** Start with a clear news reference that signals recency. Use phrases like: "UK just released...", "This week...", "Today's data shows...", "[Country/Company] announced...", "Just in...", "NYT reports..."
6. Make it OBVIOUS this is current news, not old analysis
7. Choose stories with global business implications, not just regional politics

## PIECE 2 - INTELLIGENCE EXAMPLE (for the "What We Do" page)

This appears right after: "We believe intelligence lives in questions, not answers."

This is a CALLBACK to the news from the landing page. It should feel like: "Remember that story? Here's the question it triggered."

Reference the SAME news story from Piece 1, but show a DIFFERENT ANGLE - a penetrating question that reveals how you think. Make it:
- Witty
- Cool
- Bright
- Unique thinking
- Shows pattern recognition across domains

**Format:** "[Brief reference to the same news], for example. We read that and our mind goes to: [unexpected, penetrating question that shows unique thinking]"

Under 45 words total.

The question should connect dots others miss - economics, human behavior, incentives, unintended consequences, etc.

## CRITICAL RULES FOR BOTH

- **NO DASHES.** Not em-dashes, not hyphens between words. Use periods or commas instead.
- Super informal. Conversational. Like you're texting a CEO friend.
- Universal appeal. Reference things everyone knows (markets, tech, governments, companies).
- Unique thinking. Connect dots no one else connects.
- BOTH pieces must reference the SAME news story for perfect coherence

## AVOID

- War, violence, or death (including historical atrocities)
- Sexual assault or abuse stories
- Trump, Biden, or politically divisive figures
- Regional/local stories only one country would know
- Academic or philosophical language
- Obvious observations everyone already made

## Examples of good PIECE 1

"Tesla just slashed prices 20% and everyone's panicking about demand collapse. That's not desperation. That's margin testing at scale. Most companies spend millions on focus groups to learn what Elon learns by Tuesday."

"UK just released unemployment data showing 5% jobless rate. Everyone sees recession. We see something else. When job listings hit record highs the same week unemployment spikes, that's not economic decline. That's a matching crisis."

## Examples of good PIECE 2

"The Tesla price cuts, for example. We read that and our mind goes to: is this margin testing or demand panic, and what does the timing tell us about Q4 guidance?"

## PIECE 3 - CONSULTING INSIGHT (for the "What's wrong with consulting" section)

This appears after: "Every firm guards their thinking like gold. Makes sense. Scarcity creates value." and before "We went the opposite direction."

Pick ONE recent HBR article (from the list above) about consulting, strategy, transformation, or business advisory. Write 2-3 sentences (under 50 words) that:

1. **Start with "We were just reading how..."** - Reference a specific HBR article/firm/framework
2. **Acknowledge excellence:** Recognize the brilliance - their rigor, frameworks, the value they create
3. **Paint the alternative:** "But what if..." or "Imagine if..." - aspirational, not critical

**Tone:** Respectful admiration + aspirational vision. NOT critical or adversarial.

**Format:** MUST start with "We were just reading how..." or "We were just reading about..."

**Example:**
"We were just reading how BCG's new framework helps Fortune 500 CEOs navigate digital transformation. World class thinking, decades of refinement. But what if that caliber of strategic insight wasn't reserved for $50K engagements? What if every ambitious team could access it?"

## PIECE 4 - CONTENT REMINDER (for the Contact page callback)

This appears on the Contact page to remind visitors what they just saw on the landing page.

Write ONE sentence (under 35 words) that:
1. References what appeared on the landing page (the news insight from PIECE 1)
2. Acknowledges they've read through the site
3. Creates continuity and shows the content is live and current

**Format:** "Remember how the landing page showed [brief reference to the news]?"

**Example:**
"Remember how the landing page showed Tesla's price cuts testing margins in real-time?"

Keep it super casual and conversational.

## PIECE 5 - MARKET OBSERVATION (for Consulting page premium positioning)

This appears on the Direct Engagement (Consulting) page right after "Most consultants optimize for retention. We optimize for resolution."

Write ONE sentence (under 40 words) that:
1. References a current business/market pattern you're observing
2. Positions Prismatica as seeing what others miss
3. Feels insider-y and premium - like you're sharing a trade secret
4. Connects to the SAME news story from PIECE 1 (maintain coherence)

**Tone:** Confident. Sophisticated. Pattern-recognizing. Like you're at a members-only club sharing what the smart money sees.

**Format:** Start with time markers like "This week...", "Right now...", "Over the past month...", "Lately..." to signal freshness.

**Examples:**
"This week alone, three CEOs asked us the same question about their AI strategy. That's not coincidence. That's the market telling us something before it shows up in headlines."

"Right now we're watching companies panic about efficiency while missing the real pattern: their best people are solving the wrong problems brilliantly."

## PIECE 6 - PURPOSE CONTEXT (for Pioneers of Purpose service description)

This appears INLINE in the Pioneers of Purpose description on the Consulting page. Here's the FULL paragraph context:

**FULL PARAGRAPH:**
"Dissect your business from its root reason to exist. [YOUR OBSERVATION HERE]. Then cascade that purpose through every system and touchpoint. Inside-out authenticity that strengthens both internal culture and external message. Purpose as operating system, not marketing tagline."

Write ONE sentence (under 35 words) that:
1. Connects the SAME news story to purpose/culture/authenticity/alignment themes
2. Bridges the transition from "finding the root why" to "cascading it through systems"
3. Flows naturally between these specific sentences about business purpose architecture
4. Makes the reader think: "yes, that's exactly why purpose work matters"

**Context:** The paragraph is selling a service that helps businesses discover their core reason for existing (beyond profit) and then systematically embed that purpose into operations, culture, and customer experience. Your observation should reinforce why this matters NOW.

**Tone:** Sharp insight that connects current events to timeless business truth. Should feel like a knowing aside to smart readers.

**Format:** Must flow seamlessly as a natural bridge between "dissect from root reason" and "cascade through systems." Think: observation that makes the next sentence feel inevitable.

**Example (if news was about layoffs):**
"The companies surviving layoffs best already knew their answer to 'why do we exist beyond making money?'"

**Example (if news was about market shifts):**
"Right now the market's rewarding businesses where purpose isn't a poster but the actual decision-making filter."

**Example (if news was about organizational failures):**
"Notice how the organizations struggling most can't answer 'why we exist' without mentioning revenue?"

## PIECE 7 - DYNAMIC SERVICE DESCRIPTION (full Pioneers of Purpose description)

This is the ENTIRE service description for Pioneers of Purpose on the Consulting page. Your job: write exceptional copy that makes the service feel inevitable.

**THE REAL PROBLEM WE SOLVE:**
Organizations that can't answer "why do we exist beyond making money?" suffer specific symptoms:
- Layoffs/restructuring where no one can explain the strategy
- Leaders cite "culture" or "values" they can't actually define
- Internal teams pulling in conflicting directions
- External messaging that rings hollow to customers
- Decision paralysis because there's no north star
- M&A that destroys value because cultures clash
- Hiring/retention issues because people don't know what they're building toward

**WHO NEEDS THIS:**
CEOs and leadership teams who feel their organization is drifting, fractured, or hollow. Smart people solving problems brilliantly but in service of... what exactly?

**YOUR STRATEGIC TASK:**
1. Find a DIFFERENT story from the **BUSINESS HEADLINES ONLY** (Fast Company, Forbes, or Marketing Week - NOT BBC or NYT)
2. This MUST be about a specific company, CEO decision, product launch, marketing campaign, or business failure
3. Choose a story that PERFECTLY demonstrates one of those symptoms above
4. Write copy where the reader thinks: "That's us. That's the problem we have."

**NEWS SELECTION GUARDRAILS:**

AVOID (will alienate clients):
- Sexual assault/abuse stories (Epstein, Weinstein, etc.)
- Trump, Biden, or other politically divisive figures
- Culture war topics (DEI controversies, gender debates, etc.)
- War/violence (unless purely about business impact like supply chains)
- Religious controversies

PREFER (sharp but safe for B2B):
- Corporate failures/scandals (Boeing safety issues, Wells Fargo fake accounts, Theranos-style fraud)
- Tech layoffs and poor restructuring decisions (Meta, Google, Amazon layoffs)
- CEO decisions that backfired (return-to-office mandates, tone-deaf communications)
- M&A that destroyed value (HP/Autonomy, AOL/Time Warner scale disasters)
- Market disruptions everyone recognizes (Netflix vs Blockbuster, Kodak digital failure)
- Leadership/governance failures at recognizable companies

Choose news that makes CEOs think "that could be us" not "that's too controversial to discuss."

**REQUIRED CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN NATURALLY:**
- Dissect the actual root reason to exist (not the poster why)
- Cascade that purpose through systems/decisions/touchpoints
- Inside-out authenticity (internal culture + external message aligned)
- Purpose as operating system, not marketing fluff

**WHAT "EXCEPTIONAL" LOOKS LIKE:**
- The news example isn't random - it perfectly exemplifies the specific problem
- The transition feels natural, not forced
- The reader thinks: "Yes, THAT'S what we need right now"
- Every word earns its place - no generic corporate-speak

**Tone:** Sharp, knowing, premium. Like you're diagnosing the exact problem they have but couldn't articulate.

**Format:** 3-4 sentences (50-80 words). Should read like strategic insight, not a feature list.

**Example (if news was about Starbucks CEO commuting 1000 miles):**
"Starbucks just hired a CEO who'll commute 1000 miles because they couldn't define what leadership presence actually means to them. Watch organizations everywhere realize their 'values' are actually just vibes. We dissect the actual reason your business exists, then engineer that purpose into every decision, hiring criterion, and customer interaction. Inside-out authenticity that both teams and markets can feel. Purpose as operating system, not poster in the break room."

## PIECE 8 - ESI FRAMEWORK SERVICE DESCRIPTION

This is the ENTIRE service description for The ESI Framework on the Consulting page. Your job: write exceptional copy that makes transformation feel systematic, not mystical.

**THE REAL PROBLEM WE SOLVE:**
Organizations drowning in insights but paralyzed by execution. They suffer:
- Consultants deliver brilliant decks that gather dust
- Research reports that never translate to action
- Strategy workshops that produce no strategy
- Implementation teams executing the wrong thing brilliantly
- Gap between "what we discovered" and "what we actually did"
- Transformation initiatives that die in committee
- Leaders who know what's wrong but can't create momentum

**WHO NEEDS THIS:**
Leaders who are tired of insight theater. They have smart people, good data, clear problems - but can't connect discovery to execution.

**YOUR STRATEGIC TASK:**
1. Find yet ANOTHER story from the **BUSINESS HEADLINES ONLY** (Fast Company, Forbes, or Marketing Week - NOT BBC or NYT - different from PIECE 7)
2. This MUST be about a specific company, product, executive decision, or business transformation attempt
3. Choose a story that demonstrates the insight-to-execution gap
4. Write copy where the reader thinks: "Yes, we keep discovering things and then nothing happens"

**NEWS SELECTION GUARDRAILS:**
(Same as PIECE 7 - avoid controversial topics, prefer B2B-safe corporate/marketing stories)

**REQUIRED CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN NATURALLY:**
- Explore, Synthesize, Ignite (the three phases - mention these explicitly or clearly)
- Operating system for transformation (not a one-time engagement)
- Explore uncovers truth
- Synthesize turns discovery into clarity
- Ignite makes clarity executable
- Research, strategy, and execution as continuous loop (not sequential waterfall)

**WHAT "EXCEPTIONAL" LOOKS LIKE:**
- News example perfectly shows the insight-to-execution gap
- The transition makes ESI feel like the obvious solution
- Reader thinks: "This is exactly why our transformation efforts fail"
- Language is systematic/methodical, not fluffy or inspirational

**Tone:** Precise, systematic, slightly technical. Like you're showing them an engine, not giving a pep talk.

**Format:** 3-4 sentences (50-80 words). Should read like you're describing infrastructure, not magic.

**Example (if news was about a failed merger):**
"HP-Autonomy destroyed $8.8 billion because insight and integration lived in separate universes. Everyone saw the cultural mismatch, no one had a system to fix it. Explore, Synthesize, Ignite: our operating system for closing that gap. Explore uncovers the truth, Synthesize turns discovery into executable clarity, Ignite makes strategy move. Research, strategy, execution - continuous loop, not three separate consulting engagements."

## PIECE 9 - SECRET AGENCY SERVICE DESCRIPTION

This is the ENTIRE service description for Secret Agency on the Consulting page. Your job: write exceptional copy that makes high-performers recognize their own patterns.

**THE REAL PROBLEM WE SOLVE:**
High-performers trapped in patterns that worked...until they didn't:
- CEOs drowning in decisions that used to be easy
- Executives confusing busyness with effectiveness
- Leaders working 70 hours but producing 40 hours of actual value
- Decision fatigue masquerading as strategic thinking
- Burnout disguised as dedication
- Work/life integration that's really just all work
- Performance optimization replaced by performance theater
- Can't remember the last time they did deep work vs reacted to noise

**WHO NEEDS THIS:**
Executives and founders who realize they're optimizing the wrong variable. Smart, accomplished, exhausted. They know something's broken but can't see it from inside the pattern.

**YOUR STRATEGIC TASK:**
1. Find a story from the **LEADERSHIP HEADLINES ONLY** (Wired, Inc, or The Atlantic - NOT other feeds)
2. This MUST be about CEO burnout, executive performance, work/life balance, decision quality, or high-performer traps
3. Choose a story where the reader thinks: "That's me. I'm doing that."
4. Write copy that feels like you're reading their mind

**NEWS SELECTION GUARDRAILS:**
PREFER stories about:
- CEO/founder burnout
- Executive decision fatigue
- Work/life balance failures at the top
- High-performer traps (perfectionism, overwork, saying yes to everything)
- Performance vs performative work
- Leaders who can't delegate/let go
- Successful people who feel hollow

AVOID:
- General productivity tips
- Junior employee issues
- Work-from-home debates
- Corporate culture fluff
- Anything not specific to high-performers/executives

**REQUIRED CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN NATURALLY:**
- This is for high-performers who've outgrown their patterns
- Focus on effectiveness vs busyness
- Decision quality over decision quantity
- Strategic clarity over reactive firefighting
- "Secret Agency" implies confidential, personal, high-touch

**WHAT "EXCEPTIONAL" LOOKS LIKE:**
- The news example makes them say "That's exactly what I'm dealing with"
- The transition feels like you understand their specific pain
- Language is direct, no fluff - they don't have time
- Tone is knowing, not prescriptive - peer to peer, not coach to client

**Tone:** Direct, knowing, slightly provocative. Like a peer who sees through their bullshit. No inspirational fluff.

**Format:** 3-4 sentences (50-80 words). Should read like someone who gets what it's like at the top.

**Example (if news was about CEO burnout):**
"Shopify's CEO just announced he's stepping back to 'think' because he forgot how. Join the club. We work with founders who realize their 70-hour weeks are 40 hours of email and 30 hours of decisions they trained their team not to make. Secret Agency: where high-performers learn to optimize for impact, not inbox zero. Because busy and effective stopped being the same thing years ago."

## PIECE 10 - KSO WORKSHOP SERVICE DESCRIPTION

This is the ENTIRE service description for KSO (Knowledge Search Optimization) Workshop on the Consulting page. Your job: write exceptional copy that makes the AI-era search shift feel urgent and inevitable.

**THE REAL PROBLEM WE SOLVE:**
Traditional SEO is dying because AI doesn't work like Google:
- ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI search engines cite knowledge, not links
- Authority comes from owning intellectual territory, not ranking for keywords
- Brands discoverable in Google but invisible to AI systems
- Content optimized for crawlers, not comprehension
- SEO teams still playing 2015's game in 2025's world
- Knowledge graphs matter more than backlinks
- AI citations > search rankings

**WHO NEEDS THIS:**
Marketing leaders and founders who realize their SEO strategy is increasingly irrelevant. They rank on Google but AI never mentions them. Smart enough to see the shift, not sure how to adapt.

**YOUR STRATEGIC TASK:**
1. Find a story from **BUSINESS or LEADERSHIP HEADLINES** about AI search, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google's decline, or AI disrupting content/marketing
2. This MUST demonstrate how AI is changing discovery, search, or content strategy
3. Choose a story where marketers think: "Oh shit, our entire SEO strategy is obsolete"
4. Write copy that makes the AI-era shift feel like it's happening NOW, not someday

**NEWS SELECTION GUARDRAILS:**
PREFER stories about:
- ChatGPT/AI search overtaking Google
- Perplexity, SearchGPT disrupting search
- AI citation engines
- Content strategy for AI era
- Brands winning/losing in AI search
- Google's declining relevance
- Knowledge graphs and AI indexing

AVOID:
- General AI hype
- Technical AI development (unless about search)
- AI ethics debates
- Anything not about discovery/search/content

**REQUIRED CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN NATURALLY:**
- AI systems index knowledge, not URLs
- Authority = owning intellectual territory
- Knowledge graphs and narrative ownership
- SEO makes you searchable, KSO makes you unforgettable (or similar contrast)
- AI citations > traditional rankings

**WHAT "EXCEPTIONAL" LOOKS LIKE:**
- The news example makes marketers realize their SEO investment is at risk
- The transition shows KSO as the obvious next move
- Language is forward-looking, not fear-mongering
- Tone is knowing - "we saw this coming, did you?"

**Tone:** Sharp, forward-looking, slightly provocative. Like you're ahead of the curve and inviting them to catch up.

**Format:** 3-4 sentences (50-80 words). Should feel like you're describing the future that's already here.

**Example (if news was about AI search overtaking Google):**
"Perplexity just hit 100M queries/month while Google's search share drops for the first time in 20 years. Traditional SEO optimizes for a disappearing game. KSO Workshop: we map your intellectual territory into knowledge graphs AI systems actually understand and cite. Four weeks to transform from searchable to authoritative. Because when AI answers questions, being on page one of Google means nothing."

## PIECE 11 - TRANSACTION ARCHITECTURE SERVICE DESCRIPTION

This is the ENTIRE service description for The Transaction Architecture™ on the Consulting page. Your job: write exceptional copy that makes conversion optimization feel like architecture, not manipulation.

**THE REAL PROBLEM WE SOLVE:**
Most businesses optimize touchpoints but don't understand the actual value exchange:
- Marketing teams chase clicks without understanding what causes conversion
- Sales funnels leak at every stage because touchpoints don't trigger transactions
- Customer journeys map steps but miss the psychological shifts that matter
- Conversion rate optimization treats symptoms, not the underlying value architecture
- Companies measure behavior but can't see the emotional/cognitive/tangible dimensions
- Appeal without substance OR substance without appeal (rarely both)

**WHO NEEDS THIS:**
CMOs, growth leaders, founders who realize their conversion problems aren't tactical. They've A/B tested everything and still don't know WHY people buy (or don't).

**YOUR STRATEGIC TASK:**
1. Find a story from **BUSINESS or MARKETING HEADLINES** about conversion problems, customer journey failures, marketing ROI struggles, or brands with great products but poor uptake
2. This MUST show the gap between surface-level tactics and deep understanding
3. Choose a story where marketers think: "We're optimizing the wrong thing"
4. Write copy that reframes conversion as architecture, not tactics

**NEWS SELECTION GUARDRAILS:**
PREFER stories about:
- Brands with conversion/adoption problems despite good products
- Marketing campaigns that look good but don't convert
- Customer behavior that doesn't match predictions
- Companies discovering why people really buy (or don't)
- Failed product launches despite huge marketing spend
- Disconnect between brand appeal and actual transactions

AVOID:
- Simple A/B test wins (too tactical)
- Tech platform changes (unless about conversion psychology)
- General marketing trends
- Anything purely about creative/design

**REQUIRED CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN NATURALLY:**
- Three dimensions: spiritual (emotional), cognitive (understanding), tangible (action)
- Value exchange not just value proposition
- Conversion through understanding, not manipulation
- Touchpoints as transaction triggers
- Deep truth meets surface appeal

**WHAT "EXCEPTIONAL" LOOKS LIKE:**
- The news example exposes shallow thinking about why people buy
- The transition shows Transaction Architecture as a fundamentally different lens
- Language is sophisticated but clear
- Tone is knowing - you see what others miss

**Tone:** Analytical but not dry. Like an architect explaining why a building stands - it's about forces, not decoration.

**Format:** 3-4 sentences (50-80 words). Should feel like you're revealing the hidden architecture beneath visible behavior.

**Example (if news was about a failed product launch):**
"Brand X spent $10M launching a brilliant product that nobody bought. They optimized every touchpoint but missed the actual value exchange. Transaction Architecture: we map how decisions happen across emotional resonance, understanding shifts, and tangible triggers. Then design every interaction to complete those transactions. Because surface appeal without deep alignment doesn't convert - it just looks pretty."

## PIECE 12 - STRATEGIC TRIPTYCH ASSESSMENT SERVICE DESCRIPTION

This is the ENTIRE service description for The Strategic Triptych Assessment™ on the Consulting page. Your job: write exceptional copy that makes holistic diagnosis feel obvious and urgent.

**THE REAL PROBLEM WE SOLVE:**
Most business problems aren't in any single area - they're in the gaps:
- Marketing doesn't know what product is building
- Product doesn't understand competitive positioning
- Strategy ignores operational reality
- Everyone optimizing their silo while the system fails
- Symptoms in one area, root cause in another
- Can't see the forest because each team owns one tree
- "Something's off" but can't pinpoint where

**WHO NEEDS THIS:**
Leaders who sense misalignment but can't diagnose it. They've tried fixing individual functions but the problems persist. Smart enough to know the issue is systemic.

**YOUR STRATEGIC TASK:**
1. Find a story from **BUSINESS HEADLINES** about companies missing obvious opportunities, failing despite strong individual capabilities, or discovering problems were in the gaps between functions
2. This MUST show how siloed thinking creates blind spots
3. Choose a story where leaders think: "How did we miss that?"
4. Write copy that makes simultaneous multi-lens diagnosis feel like the only rational approach

**NEWS SELECTION GUARDRAILS:**
PREFER stories about:
- Companies with strong teams but poor results
- Businesses missing obvious strategic opportunities
- Organizational dysfunction despite talented people
- Competitive losses that shouldn't have happened
- "How did they miss that?" moments
- Strategic pivots that reveal years of misalignment
- Post-mortem revelations about preventable failures

AVOID:
- Simple execution failures
- External shocks (market crashes, etc.)
- Individual leader failures
- Technical problems

**REQUIRED CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN NATURALLY:**
- Three lenses: how you market, compete, build
- Problems live in the gaps
- Opportunities live in the gaps too
- Simultaneous examination (not sequential)
- Finding what's been hiding in plain sight

**WHAT "EXCEPTIONAL" LOOKS LIKE:**
- The news example makes readers ask "how did smart people miss that?"
- The transition shows Triptych as obvious-in-retrospect
- Language emphasizes simultaneity and system-level thinking
- Tone is diagnostic, like a doctor finding what others missed

**Tone:** Clinical but not cold. Like revealing a blind spot that was always there.

**Format:** 3-4 sentences (50-80 words). Should feel like you're pointing at something that's now impossible to unsee.

**Example (if news was about a company missing market shift):**
"Company Y had brilliant product teams, strong marketing, clear strategy. Still lost 40% market share in 18 months because nobody saw how their competitive moat was eroding while product roadmap ignored it. Strategic Triptych Assessment: we examine marketing, competition, and execution simultaneously. Most problems hide in those gaps. Most opportunities too."
