# HOME PAGE - STRANGER STATE (First Visit)
**Current source:** `app/welcome/page.tsx`
**When:** First-ever visit, no session data
**Objective:** Prove capability, create intrigue, NO navigation yet
**User leaves thinking:** "They think differently. Let me explore."

## SECTION 1: IDENTITY (Above Fold)

### Hero
```
FINALLY
THINKING AS A SERVICE
```

### Intro
```
We're Prismatica Labs.

We solve problems with thinking, not themes.
```

---

## SECTION 2: POSITIONING

```
Intelligence begins where answers end.

Answers are cheap. Google has them. ChatGPT has them. Your competitor's intern has them.
```

---

## SECTION 3: PROOF

### Dynamic Proof Card
```
Label: "Right now:"

[DYNAMIC CONTENT: newsInsight]
```

### Payoff
```
The point is... are you asking the right questions?
```

### Silent Thought (Red Accent Bar)
```
Split reality into new variables. New colours emerge. Like light through a prism.
```

---

## SECTION 4: PHILOSOPHY

```
This is a website. It loads fast, tells you what we do. Everything here serves that purpose.

Focus is the only currency that matters. You get it when you remove noise.

Welcome to the quietest room on the internet.
```

## NOTES

- **NO navigation cards** on first visit (matches current `/welcome`)
- User explores via sidebar navigation
- Clean, minimal, proof-driven
- Dynamic field: `newsInsight` (establishes baseline)
- After this visit, user has seen:
  - The positioning ("Intelligence begins where answers end")
  - One dynamic insight (`newsInsight`)
  - The philosophy statement
- **Next visit must show DIFFERENT content** (Explorer state)

## CRITICAL: What User Has Seen

After Stranger state, user knows:
1. ✅ The tagline ("Thinking as a service")
2. ✅ The positioning ("Intelligence begins...")
3. ✅ One proof point (newsInsight about current events)
4. ✅ The philosophy (focus, noise, quietest room)

**Explorer state CANNOT repeat any of this.**
