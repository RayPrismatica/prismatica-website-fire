## PRODUCT SUITE

Most product pages show you what's coming. Launch dates. Beta programs. Waitlists. They're selling you on waiting.

This isn't that.

**We built these products because we needed them. Then our friends wanted a go. Then people started asking how much. Hold on. We're all having the same problems.**

The world uses humans to make tech better. We use tech to make being human better.

### The Method

You know the old saying. Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for life.

This is different. This is *send a guy who knows how to fish and will stick around*.

We've taken consulting methods, global business wisdom, and proven tactics (the stuff that costs £50k in a workshop) and embedded them into multi-layered system prompts and code. Not surface-level AI wrappers. Deep methodology that reasons through your specific situation.

**25+ live products. New ones launching monthly. Strategic thinking codified into tools ranging from consulting frameworks to AI advisors. Some you'll use every day. Some ten minutes a month.**

Three examples:

*(Three BentoBox products shown here: Focus Matrix, Sir Alfie, Value Channel Matrix)*

Or just keep using your basic ChatGPT subscription for random LinkedIn posts. That's also fine. Your potential, your choice.

### Real Constraints

Most products say they're 'exclusive' to sound premium. That's not this.

**We filter access because selling the same advantage to competing firms destroys the advantage. If every law firm in London has the same tools, nobody has an edge. That's not strategy. That's just noise at scale.**

Tell us your industry, your challenge, your region. We'll tell you if there's capacity. We cap based on market saturation.

Real constraints, not manufactured scarcity.

Active monthly usage required (minimum 25 interactions). We're not building for max scale. We're building for max impact. The products get better when real users push them hard.

You get tools that compound. We get feedback that matters. That's the deal.

### How pricing works

**£299/month per seat gets you access to all 25+ products. API costs are separate and fully under your control.**

Every product uses AI models. You choose which model for each task. Faster models cost less. Smarter models cost more. Simple tasks use cheap models. Complex problems use expensive ones. You decide the quality/cost trade-off.

API credits work like phone minutes. Buy what you need. Use what you want. Track everything in real-time. Most users spend £50-200/month depending on usage intensity and model choices. Heavy strategic work might hit £500/month.

You're always in control.

We're not doing beta programs or waitlists. If these tools solve problems you're actually facing, let's talk about how they apply to what you're building.
