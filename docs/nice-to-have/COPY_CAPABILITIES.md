## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT

User has ALREADY seen on homepage (Stranger state):
- ❌ "Intelligence begins where answers end"
- ❌ "Answers are cheap. Google/ChatGPT have them"
- ❌ `newsInsight` dynamic content
- ❌ Philosophy section ("quietest room...")

**We CANNOT repeat any of this. Must complement, not duplicate.**

## PAGE HEADER

```
CAPABILITIES
```

---

## SECTION 1: THE PHILOSOPHY (from What We Do)

### Heading: The Consulting Status Quo

```
Brilliant minds. World-class thinking. Trapped in day rates and retainers. Proprietary methodologies you can rent but never own.

Every firm guards their thinking like gold. Makes sense. Scarcity creates value.
```

### Dynamic Insight (DIFFERENT field than homepage)
```
[DYNAMIC CONTENT: consultingInsight]
```

### Our Approach
```
So we went the opposite direction. We documented how we think. Then we turned patterns into mental models. Now those models run as code.
```

### Red Accent Statement
```
Thinking should be a utility, not a privilege.
```

---

## SECTION 2: TWO WAYS TO WORK WITH US

### Introduction
```
Heading: Two ways to work with us
```

---

### 2A: CONSULTING SERVICES (Primary Track)

**Intro Box** (red border, prominent)
```
Heading: CONSULTING SERVICES

Some problems need custom work. Every consultancy, SaaS pitch deck, and agency website uses the same words. 'Transformation over transaction.' 'Strategic partnerships.' 'Solutions.' We won't.

We work directly with you and adapt as the problem reveals itself. First call is diagnostic. If we're not finding new angles within 30 minutes, walk away.
```

**CTA:**
```
We fix things. Then we leave.
No retainers. No dependency.

[Button: Explore Services (scrolls to service bentos below)]
```

---

### 2B: PRODUCT SUITE (Secondary Track)

**Intro Box** (grey border)
```
Heading: PRODUCT SUITE

Everyone knows thinking doesn't scale. Most companies accept it. We solved it. Turned our methodology into infrastructure so your team can use it without us.

Strategic frameworks for market decisions. Question patterns for product challenges. Mental models for operational problems. Code that works with you.

Access to 25+ live products. More launching monthly. 30-day trial.
```

**Pricing:**
```
£299/month
per seat + API credits*

*API costs separate. Most users: £50-200/month.

```

**Divider**

---

## SECTION 3: CONSULTING SERVICES

### Heading: Consulting Services

**Opening Statement**
```
We fix things. Then we leave.

Most consultants optimise for retention. We optimise for resolution.

No retainers. No dependency. Every engagement has an end date.
```

---

### Tier 1: The Big Picture
**Heading:** THE BIG PICTURE

[BENTO: Pioneers of Purpose]
[BENTO: ESI Framework]
[BENTO: Secret Agency Model]
[BENTO: Transaction Architecture]
[BENTO: KSO Workshop]
[BENTO: Strategic Triptych]

---

### Tier 2: Tactical Steps Forward
**Heading:** TACTICAL STEPS FORWARD

[BENTO: Go-to-Market Sprint]
[BENTO: Creative Converts]
[BENTO: Design Thinking Reality Check]
[BENTO: AI Without Hallucination]
[BENTO: Process Surgery]
[BENTO: Marketing Reality Check]

---

### Special Terms
**Heading:** WHO GETS SPECIAL TERMS

```
NGOs get 50% off or pro-bono for the right project, impact over income. B-Corps get 20% off because you're accountable to more than shareholders, and so are we. Startups can do equity deals, we bet on futurists, not just futures.

Limited spots monthly, as we balance impact work with commercial projects to keep both sustainable. No forms. No committees. Just tell us what you're building and why it matters.
```

---

### How This Works
**Heading:** HOW THIS WORKS

```
Tell us the problem. We'll quote a fixed price and timeline. No surprises.

Some fixes take two weeks. Some take two months. None take two years.
```

---

### The Test
**Heading:** THE TEST

```
If you want a study, hire someone else. If you want a solution...

**Divider**

---

## SECTION 4: PRODUCT SUITE

### Heading: Product Suite

**Opening Statement**
```
Most product pages show you what's coming. Launch dates. Beta programs. Waitlists. They're selling you on waiting.

This isn't that.

We built these products because we needed them. Then our friends wanted a go. Then people started asking how much. Hold on. We're all having the same problems.
```

---

### Red Accent Statement
```
The world uses humans to make tech better. We use tech to make being human better.
```

---

### The Method
**Heading:** THE METHOD

```
You know the old saying. Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for life.
```

### Red Accent Statement
```
This is different. This is send a guy who knows how to fish and will stick around.
```

```
We've taken consulting methods, global business wisdom, and proven tactics (the stuff that costs £50k in a workshop) and embedded them into multi-layered system prompts and code. Not surface-level AI wrappers. Deep methodology that reasons through your specific situation.

25+ live products. New ones launching monthly. Strategic thinking codified into tools ranging from consulting frameworks to AI advisors. Some you'll use every day. Some ten minutes a month.

Three examples:
```

---

### Product Examples

[BENTO: Focus Matrix]
[BENTO: Sir Alfie]
[BENTO: Value Channel Matrix]

---

```
Or just keep using your basic ChatGPT subscription for random LinkedIn posts. That's also fine. Your potential, your choice.
```

---

### Real Constraints
**Heading:** REAL CONSTRAINTS

```
Most products say they're 'exclusive' to sound premium. That's not this.

We filter access because selling the same advantage to competing firms destroys the advantage. If every law firm in London has the same tools, nobody has an edge. That's not strategy. That's just noise at scale.

Tell us your industry, your challenge, your region. We'll tell you if there's capacity. We cap based on market saturation.

Real constraints, not manufactured scarcity.

Active monthly usage required (minimum 25 interactions). We're not building for max scale. We're building for max impact. The products get better when real users push them hard.
```

### Red Accent Statement
```
You get tools that compound. We get feedback that matters. That's the deal.
```

---

### How Pricing Works
**Heading:** HOW PRICING WORKS

```
£299/month per seat gets you access to all 25+ products. API costs are separate and fully under your control.

Every product uses AI models. You choose which model for each task. Faster models cost less. Smarter models cost more. Simple tasks use cheap models. Complex problems use expensive ones. You decide the quality/cost trade-off.

API credits work like phone minutes. Buy what you need. Use what you want. Track everything in real-time. Most users spend £50-200/month depending on usage intensity and model choices. Heavy strategic work might hit £500/month.
```

### Red Accent Statement
```
You're always in control.
```

---

### Product CTA
```
We're not doing beta programs or waitlists. If these tools solve problems you're actually facing, let's talk about how they apply to what you're building.

[Button: Check Capacity → Opens products enquiry modal]
```

## SECTION 5: TESTIMONIALS (from What We Do page)

**Heading:** TESTIMONIALS

```
We could call ten clients right now. They'd say yes. We'd get five stars, glowing quotes, the whole performance.

We both know that would mean absolutely nothing.

You're not here comparing star ratings. You don't need to see testimonials promising we 'exceeded expectations' or 'delivered on time and under budget' like we deserve a medal for basic competence.
```

### Red Accent Statement
```
You're here because you think differently about problems.
```

```
The decision to work with us is intellectual, not social. Either our thinking resonates or it doesn't, and a wall of logos won't change that. Testimonials are manufactured credibility for commodity services.

We're not a commodity. You're not a crowd. Respect works both ways.

If you need proof we can think, read what we write. Look at how we built this site. Watch how Athena, our AI Advisor, responds. That's the proof.
