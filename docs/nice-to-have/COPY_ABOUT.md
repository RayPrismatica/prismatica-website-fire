## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT

User has ALREADY seen on homepage (Stranger state):
- ❌ "Intelligence begins where answers end"
- ❌ "Answers are cheap..."
- ❌ `newsInsight` dynamic content
- ❌ "Are you asking the right questions?"
- ❌ "Split reality into new variables..."
- ❌ Philosophy section ("quietest room...")

**We CANNOT repeat any of this. Must complement, not duplicate.**

## PAGE HEADER

```
ABOUT
```

---

## SECTION 1: WHO WE ARE

### Red Accent Opening
```
A small team that thinks first and decorates never.
```

---

### Identity
```
We're not an agency. Agencies have account managers, creative directors, and people whose job is to make you feel important. We have people who do the work.

We're not a vendor. Vendors deliver what you ordered. We solve what you need.

Founded in London. Operating globally. Small by design, not by accident.
```

---

### Our Background
**Heading:** OUR BACKGROUND

```
We've worked with everyone from individual artists to Fortune 500s. The size doesn't matter. The problem does.

We've seen enough innovation theatre to know the difference between motion and progress. We've sat through enough strategy decks to know that most strategy is procrastination with charts.
```

---

### What We're Watching (Dynamic Content)
**Heading:** WHAT WE'RE WATCHING

```
[Dynamic content card with border]

[DYNAMIC CONTENT: intelligenceExample]

This changes weekly. Our analytical approach doesn't.
```

**Note:** Uses `intelligenceExample` (DIFFERENT from homepage's `newsInsight`)

---

### Our Principles
**Heading (in card):** OUR PRINCIPLES

```
[Card with white background, rounded corners]

• Showing rather than telling
• Testing rather than assuming
• Building rather than presenting
• Solving rather than discussing

---

Complexity is the job. Clarity is the deliverable.
```

---

### The 5% We Work With
**Heading:** THE 5% WE WORK WITH

```
Most companies hire consultants for credibility or convenience. Shareholder confidence. Framework delivery. Someone else to blame.

We work with the ones who hire for intelligence. Who want their thinking challenged, not their egos managed. Who need allies, not authorities.

95% of businesses need consulting. 5% need what we do.
```

---

**Divider**

---

## SECTION 2: MENTAL MODELS (How We Think)

### Heading: How We Think

```
Most consultancies explain their frameworks. We show you what happened when we used them.

Eight problems. Eight different industries. Same way of seeing.
```

---

### Problems We've Thought About
**Heading:** PROBLEMS WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT

```
Details are vague by design. Not just NDAs. We don't trade client specifics for marketing material.

What matters: the problem structure, how we saw it, what changed.
```

---

### Case Brief Grid (2 columns)

[Interactive brief buttons - 8 total]
1. The Warehouse That Wasn't
2. The Search Nobody Needed
3. From Push to Pull
4. The Misdiagnosed Bottleneck
5. The £15K Canyon
6. From Retail to Platform
7. Classical Music for Running
8. The Coaching Wave

*(Each opens modal with full brief: Problem / How We Saw It / Result)*

---

### Pattern Recognition
```
See? Different industries. Different contexts. Different surface problems.

But look closer. They're all the same underneath.
```

---

### The Physics of Business
```
Every business problem is physics. Forces trying to move through constraints. Energy seeking equilibrium. Parts colliding until something breaks or something works.

The details change. The structure doesn't.

Physics governs reality. So it should govern how we think. Light through a prism reveals what was always there but invisible. That's what we are passionate about. The tangible invisible. That's why we're called Prismatica.
```

---

### First Principles
**Heading:** FIRST PRINCIPLES

```
Strip away the details. Seven components remain:
```

**The 7 Components:**

1. **TIME**
   The window narrows. Momentum builds or dies. Opportunity decays.

2. **ACTORS**
   Who can say yes. Who can say no. Who just gets affected.

3. **RESOURCES**
   What you have to work with. Never enough of what matters.

4. **OBJECTIVES**
   What everyone's actually after. Surprisingly identical across industries.

5. **CONSTRAINTS**
   The edges of possibility. Physics, budgets, regulations, human nature.

6. **INFORMATION**
   What you know, what they know, what nobody knows yet.

7. **INCENTIVES**
   What people say drives them. What actually drives them.

---

### Emergent Patterns
**Heading:** EMERGENT PATTERNS

```
When parts collide, they form molecules. Structures with mass, direction, momentum. These patterns have velocity. They want to move:
```

**The 5 Molecules:**

1. **DEMAND**
   People who want something, know something, need something.
   *Components: Actors + Objectives + Information*

2. **SUPPLY**
   What's possible to deliver, given what you have and how long you have it.
   *Components: Resources + Constraints + Time*

3. **FRICTION**
   Everything that slows you down. Rules, misaligned incentives, missing information.
   *Components: Constraints + Information + Incentives*

4. **VALUE**
   What you can create when resources meet real objectives for real people.
   *Components: Resources + Objectives + Actors*

5. **RISK**
   The gap between what you're betting on and what you actually know. Ticking.
   *Components: Time + Information + Objectives*

---

### The Models
**Heading:** THE MODELS

```
Five systems for seeing what's actually happening:
```

---

#### Model 1: DEMAND

```
Rolex doesn't sell watches. Peloton doesn't sell bikes. Slack doesn't sell chat. They sell status, tribe membership, professional identity. Your product is the excuse. The demand is primal. Miss this and your marketing is just noise.

[Button: Explore Demand → /demand]
```

---

#### Model 2: INCENTIVES

```
Sales says they want better leads. What they optimize for is easy closes. Product says they want user feedback. What they optimize for is no complaints. Executives say they want innovation. What they optimize for is no surprises. Watch what they do, not what they say.

[Button: Explore Incentives → /incentives]
```

---

#### Model 3: AGENTIC

```
Humans need meetings, check-ins, approvals, reassurance. AI doesn't. Give it clear objectives, hard constraints, quality thresholds, and kill switches. Then let it run while you sleep. The bottleneck isn't the AI. It's your need to feel in control.

[Button: Explore Agentic → /agentic]
```

---

#### Model 4: PRISMATIC

```
Every industry thinks it's special. None of them are. Nightclubs and enterprise sales are both gatekeeping. Museums and Netflix are both attention retention. Airports and emergency rooms are both triage under constraints. See structure, not surface, and solutions transfer instantly.

[Button: Explore Prismatic → /prismatic]
```

---

#### Model 5: TRIPTYCH

```
Most companies fight the wrong battle. They add supply when friction is the problem. Remove friction when demand doesn't exist. Build features when distribution is broken. Stop guessing. Map the forces. Fix what's actually stuck.

[Button: Explore Triptych → /triptych]
```

---

### Conclusion
```
These aren't solutions. They're the palette. Once you see the structure, the path becomes obvious.

Most objectives are identical across industries. Most friction is predictable. Most energy is wasted fighting the wrong constraint.

We start with demand. Always. Because understanding what people actually want eliminates most strategy debates before they start.

- ✅ Principles card
- ✅ The 5% we work with
- ✅ Complete mental models system
- ✅ 8 case briefs

### Dynamic Content Fields Used:
- `intelligenceExample` ("What We're Watching" section)
- NO `newsInsight` (user already saw on homepage)
