  "overview": "These cases show molecules and models in action. Deliberately vague (NDAs, but also: principles matter more than specifics). Each reveals a pattern that repeats everywhere once you see it.",
  "cases": {
    "warehouse": {
      "title": "The Warehouse That Wasn't",
      "pattern": "Supply Chain Diagnostics",

    "bottleneck": {
      "title": "The Misdiagnosed Bottleneck",
      "pattern": "Operations",
      "insight": "Approval wasn't slow. Work arriving at approval was incomplete. Fixed upstream, not downstream.",
