Tangible and intangible forces. Customer psychology from Maslow to Jung. What particles actually move people. Makes sure whoever takes the hardest step forward gets more than they put in. 10% more? Good. 30% more? They'll never leave you.\n\nOffering architecture they can't refuse. Overdelivery by design. This isn't marketing tactics. This is value engineering."
